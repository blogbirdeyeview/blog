[{"content":" Madrid, Spain Travel date August 2022 Check other cities in Spain Capital of Spain Bienvenidos a Madrid! As you step foot in Spain’s capital, be sure to pack your walking shoes. Get ready to explore one of Spain’s most cultural cities.\nExploring the Attractions There is a lot to see and do in Madrid, but luckily everything is located relatively close together in the city center. That’s not to say that you won’t be walking at least 15,000 steps a day. But no need to fear. Madrid is also connected by subways and buses. All you need is a transportation card (which you can buy at any subway station).\nFor the museum enthusiasts Madrid is Spain’s hub of museums. If you’re like me, you may find museums a bit of a drag. But, there are plenty of options to attract all of your interests. So, if you happen to have a rainy day in Madrid, or you are looking to absorb artistic culture, check out these options.\nMuseo del Prado (famous art museum in Spain known especially for its Velázquez paintings)\nMuseo de Reina Sofía (contemporary art museum)\nTIP: If you are a student or teacher, check for discounts! And always travel with your student or teacher ID\nFor those who enjoy strolls in the park Like many European cities, Madrid is filled with parks, both big and small, to spend a nice afternoon.\nEl Retiro: huge park near the Prado museum. Be sure to bring your walking shoes. You can spend hours roaming around the park. There is even a small pond inside if you’d like to rent a paddle boat\nCampo del Moro: Beautiful garden behind the Royal Palace.\nMirador de la Montaña de Príncipe Pío: This is a beautiful lookout over the city of Madrid. There is also a park to walk through and the temple of Debod (Spain’s only Egyptian temple) which you can visit. A great place to see the sunset!\nCheck that off the list Of course, you can’t leave Madrid without hitting a few of the famous tourist locations.\nPlaza Mayor\nPalacio Real de Madrid\nPalacio Real de Madrid Gran Vía (Center of shopping in Madrid)\nLa Puerta del Sol (Madrid’s central square)\nThe Cultural Hub of Food The best part about capital cities is that they often offer the biggest variety of food options in the country.

Valparaíso and Viña del Mar are only about 2 hours in bus from Santiago. They are right next to each other, so you can experience them both. Here, you can find miles of beaches, colorful street art, and amazing culture. Welcome to Valparaíso and Viña Del Mar.\nStreet art in Valparaíso Transportation in Valpo/Viña Viña Del Mar and Valparaíso are connected by a metro. All you need to do is buy a metro card which can be bought in any metro station.\nUnfortunately, the metro will not get you to many tourist attractions. There is also a bus system that can help.\nThe bus system in Chile is a bit complicated. While there are bus stops, a bus will most likely stop anywhere you are if you lift up your hand to signal the bus driver. Once on the bus, you can pay the bus driver. They only accept cash or coins (small bills). A bus trip will usually cost less than 1 dollar. There is no special bus card and you cannot pay with a credit card. Once you pay, find a seat or hold on because the bus will start moving, fast! Bus drivers in Chile are crazy. They drive super fast and sometimes even with the doors open. If you want to get off the bus, you have to touch the button and get off quick when the bus stops.\nTIP: Be careful of theft on buses and metros. Try not to take out your phone and make sure to keep your purse or backpack in front of you.\nTIP: There are many people that come into the bus and metro to try to sell small items like candies or drinks. This is illegal in Chile, but it happens all the time. It is also illegal to buy from them. I would recommend not buying from these people.\nFor the Beach Bums Looking for a relaxing day at the beach? Want to learn how to surf? Hoping to see a beautiful sunset over the ocean? Look no more! Viña del Mar and Valparaíso are both costal cities that will satisfy your vacation plans. Valparaíso is the major port of Chile, so the beaches are better for swimming a little bit more north in Viña and Reñaca.\nTIP: In Chile, the seasons are opposite of the Northern Hemisphere. So, the summer season is from December-March. Spend a Christmas on the beach!\nAlong the Coast Castillo Wulff: Beautiful castle that overlooks the ocean. Stop and take pictures and walk around.\nMuelle Vergara: Enjoy a beautiful sunset from this dock. Walk along the beach and dip your toes in the water.\nReñaca beaches: Reñaca is another city close to Viña Del Mar. These beaches tend to be cleaner and more popular for swimming. There are also many restaurants near by!\nSunset over the Pacific Ocean Dunas de Concón: Spend the afternoon hiking up the sand dunes! I recommend renting a sand board and going sand boarding (like snow boarding but on sand!). Stay to watch the gorgeous sunset over the ocean.\nPlaya La Boca Concon: This beach is super popular for surfing. Rent a surfboard and suit for a very reasonable price.\nPlaya Las Cujas: Beautiful beach about an hour and a half north of Viña del Mar\nTIP: Many beaches in Chile have stray dogs wondering around. They are usually harmless, but give them food or pet them and they might follow you home. Also, watch out for dog poop on the beach!\nFor the outdoorsy people Jardín Botánico Nacional de Viña Del Mar: Take a bus ride out to Viña’s botanical garden. There is a small entry fee. Spend the day enjoying the beautiful nature and wildlife inside. Jardín Botánico Nacional Laguna Sausalito: Take a stroll around this gorgeous lagoon. Right outside Viña center.\nQuinta Vergara: Roam around this park in Viña Del Mar. There is a museum inside the park and a concert stadium where they hold the famous Viña Del Mar concert every summer.\nPaseo 21 de Mayo de Valparaíso: Valparaíso is the city of hills! It’s like the San Francisco of Chile. Paseo 21 de Mayo is a lookout that overlooks the port of Valparaíso. You can walk or take the funicular.\nWhat more? Reloj de Flores de Viña Del Mar: Right in between Viña and Valparaíso is a flower clock! And the clock works!\nCasa Museo La Sebastiana: Enter one of Pablo Neruda’s houses and learn about the Chilean poet’s life.\nEscalera Piano: Take a picture with these famous piano painted stairs. Walk around and enjoy the incredible street art painted on the buildings.\nPiano stairs For the Wine-Os In my unbiased opinion, Chile is home to the best wine in the world. Take a day trip exploring the vineyards of Casablanca. Unfortunately, there is no public transportation that will bring you to a vineyard. You will have to arrange a tour, take a taxi, or rent a car.\nOnce you are in the region of Casablanca, you have many options for different vineyards. Each one will offer a tour and tasting. Tours and tastings are relatively cheap and quite interesting. Tours are usually offered in Spanish or English.\nI recommend not buying a bottle of wine at the vineyard. It will most likely be expensive. But, do not leave Chile without bringing a bottle or two of wine in your suitcase. Fantastic wine can be bought at any local grocery store.\nWine Cellar A comer You cannot leave Chile without having at least 10 empanadas. My favorite are oven baked empanadas, but many prefer the fried ones. Either way, be sure to try the “pino” empanada. This is the traditional empanada of Chile that contains onion, beef, egg, and a black olive. Not your taste? No worries. There are plenty of options, from seafood to vegetables to fruit, that will be sure to satisfy everyone.\nBe sure to embrace the culture with a Piscola or Pisco Sour. Pisco is the national liquor of Chile and is traditionally mixed with Coca Cola or made into a lemon cocktail.\nRestaurants recommended by friends and myself:\nJarBar Viña: rooftop bar\nHelados Coletti: Delicious ice cream\nTierra de Fuego: Fancy restaurant near the coast\nIdílico Restobar: Pizzas, burgers, and big mojitos\nRockola Diner: Typical American diner\nCafé Journal: Seafood\nA Mano Gin and Burgers: Burgers\nPizzeria Ecuador: Fantastic pizza\nDelicias Express: Empanadas\n","permalink":"https://blogbirdeyeview.github.io/posts/chile/valparaiso/","summary":"Valpo/Viña, Chile Travel date March 2020 Check other cities in Chile Street Art Capital of Chile When traveling to Chile, don’t miss out on the exciting coastal cities of Valparaíso and Viña Del Mar.

Thinking of taking a trip to Scandinavia? Definitely put Copenhagen, Denmark on your list. I decided to take a solo trip to Copenhagen and Stockholm for a week. I would recommend this trip to all. There is so much to see and experience in these two capital cities.\nCopenhagen Card If you are like me, and are traveling alone, and I recommend buying the Copenhagen card. This card includes free entrance into almost all the attractions that Copenhagen has to offer, along with free access to public transport in Copenhagen and free airport transport. The card is 60 euros and lasts for 24 hours. Of course, 60 euros sounds like a lot of money, but Copenhagen is generally an expensive city. With this card you can enter all the museums and castles, go on a boat tour and enter the famous Tívoli park for a single price. That being said, you have to be an ambitious person to try to see as much as you can (paid attractions) within the 24 hours. Here are a few attractions that I checked off my list using the Copenhagen Card.\nTívoli Gardens: Free entrance only (attractions you have to pay extra for): Beautiful garden with an amusement park inside\nCopenhagen Zoo: A bit outside the city center, but easy to arrive by public transport (which is included in the Copenhagen card price)\nGuinness World Record Museum: Very fun museum to walk through and see the most random world records.\nAmalienborg Palace\nChristiansburg Palace\nStatins Museum for Kunst: Art Museum\nBoat Tour\nExploring for Free When your card runs out, or you are looking for a cheaper way to enjoy the city, visit some destinations that are free!

Welcome to Granada! Granada is located in the southern part of Spain, called Andalucía. Here, you will hear people speaking Spanish! In the tourist center, you can find people who speak English in some shops and restaurants. Granada is home to the most visited attraction in Spain, the Alhambra.\nArriving at Granada Granada is a small city in Spain with a population of only about 200,000. There are several ways to arrive to Granada.\nAirplane: Granada has a small “international” airport. While it is international, the only countries you can travel directly to are England and France. But, you can take a connection flight from Madrid or Barcelona. The closest bigger airport is in Malaga, Spain. From Malaga, you can take a train or bus to Granada, which takes about 2 hours. Bus: Granada is connected to many Spanish cities by bus. A popular bus company is called Alsa. Train: Granada has a train station directly in the city center! The company is called Renfe. The train to and from Granada will only take you inside of Spain. If you are coming from outside of Spain, you will need to take a few connections. Deciding on when to travel When planning your trip to the south of Spain, be sure to consider the weather conditions. Granada is extremely hot in the summer months: June, July, and August. Temperatures can reach over 40 degrees Celsius / 104 degrees Fahrenheit on a daily basis.\nThe winter months: December, January, and February have moderate temperatures, the minimum reaching about -5 degrees Celsius / 23 degrees Fahrenheit. In Granada, you almost never see snow in the center, but you will most likely see snow in the Sierra Nevada mountains. Granada is a mostly sunny region, so pack your sunscreen and your sunglasses, even in the winter!\nLos Miradores (Lookouts) The best part about Granada is all of its incredible views. Granada is a hilly city, so bring your walking shoes and get ready to put in about 20,000 steps a day!\nTIP: It is easy to get “lost” in the streets of Granada. They were designed that way to run away from invaders! But, most streets are connected, so don’t worry. Use google maps, ask someone you see, and just explore! Roaming through the narrow streets of Granada is the best way to experience the city.\nThe best lookouts Mirador San Nicolas / Patio de la Mezquita Mayor del Albaicín de Época Nazarí: This lookout is often very crowded but has a great view of the Alhambra. You can walk or take a bus to San Nicolas church. There are often people playing Flamenco music and selling paintings and souvenirs. To get away from the crowds, head over to the Mezquita (Mosque) which is right by San Nicolas church. This part is always a lot quieter and still has an amazing view. Mirador San Miguel: If you thought San Nicolas was an uphill walk, brace yourself for San Miguel. But no worries, there is also a bus that can take you up. This point gives you another great view of the Alhambra. Many people go to watch the sunrise or sunset from this point. Mirador del Barranco del Abogado: This is my favorite hidden gem. This lookout is unknown to many people. It does not give you a view of the Alhambra, but you have a spectacular view of the city. It is also a steep hike up, but you can find a bus that will bring you pretty close. Relaxing Scenery While in Granada, take advantage of its various parks to relax and have a picnic!\nCarmen de los Martires Garden near the Alhambra. It is quite the hike up the hill, but there is also a bus that takes you right outside the garden. Inside the garden, there are beautiful fountains, plants, bridges, and even some wildlife! There are a few peacocks that live here! Not to mention that this garden has another great view of the city. So, from sunrise to sunset, head to Carmen de los Martires to take some incredible pictures in this peaceful sanctuary. Parque Tico Medina Park right outside of Granada’s science museum, Parque de las Ciencias. (TIP: Parque de las Ciencias is a great, interactive museum for children and adults.) It is a great place to have a picnic when the weather is nice outside! Parque Federico García Lorca A beautiful park with my flowers, trees, and open spaces. There are even two snack bars within the park. Tapa Hop Instead of a bar hop, take your very own tapa hop in Granada. Granada is filled with tapa bars and is one of the only cities in Spain where every drink comes with a free tapa!\nTIP: Some tapas places have a menu to select the tapa you want, while others are random tapas. Make sure to tell the waiter if you have any dietary restrictions.\nTapa Bars El Oju: Vegan Tapas! Bar La Riviera: Very cool vibe, many kinds of tapas La Gioconda: Best to go when the weather is nice, and you can sit outside RompeCabezas El Peruano: Peruvian tapas bar Grifos y Tapas Tired of Tapas? No, tapas are not the only thing Granada has to offer. There are also many great restaurants to enjoy a bigger lunch or dinner.\nMilonga: Argentinian food Divino: Italian cuisine Nickel Burger: Burgers Wild Food: Vegan restaurant Cafes and Ice Cream Be sure to enjoy the abundance of cafes and heladerías around the city! Even try a famous Spanish churro!\nPastelería El Sol: For coffee, tea, and pastries Los Italianos: The best ice cream in town (only open in the summer) Heladería Mamma Alice: Popular ice cream place by the river El Buen Churro: Delicious churros Tourist Attractions Granada is one of the most visited cities in Spain. It’s known for its plazas, fountains, cathedrals, and especially for the Alhambra.\nCathedrals Catedral de Granada Capilla Real de Granada Iglesia Parroquial del Sagrario The Alhambra Be sure to get Alhambra tickets well in advance. I recommend going during the day rather than at night. The best view of the Alhambra at night is from a mirador. To get to the Alhambra, you can walk (very steep) or take the bus. If you take the bus, be sure to walk down for the beautiful scenery.\nFor your first visit, I recommend buying the Alhambra General (full visit) ticket.\nAdult tickets: 19,09 euros Youth (12-15): 12,73 euros Child (3-11): Free Youth and senior citizens of the European Union are offered discounts TIP: Be sure to bring your ticket and passport to the Alhambra! They will scan your passport several times during your journey.\nTIP: While it is pricy, it is worth it. You cannot go to Granada without seeing the Alhambra.\nWith the full visit, you have access to everything. Your entry time on your ticket is for the Palacios Nazaries section. This means that you can arrive whenever you want, but you need to be at the Palacios Nazaries section at your specific time. The rest of the castle is open for you to visit at your pace.\nYou will need at least a few hours inside the Alhambra. I recommend scheduling a whole day in your itinerary so that you can take your time. The Alhambra is huge! Be sure to also check out the towers. There are many steps, but it is worth it! There is a gorgeous view from the top.\nCultural Experiences Flamenco Dancing: Andalucía is the best place to see Flamenco dancing in Spain. Buy a ticket and enjoy the show! Arab Market: Granada has many Arab influences marked throughout the city. La Alcaicería is recreation of the old Moorish market that existed here before. It is a narrow street filled with small shops. Here you can find some souvenirs that represent Granada. Sacromonte: Walk through the Sacromonte quarter of Granada. It is a gipsy quarter located in the hills of Granada. There you can see typical cave homes. In addition, it is likely to find many flamenco shows in this area in the evening. Looking for more? If you have more time in Granada, take a small day trip to the mountains or the sea. Granada center is located about 1 hour from the Sierra Nevada mountains and 1 hour from the sea. You can take a bus to both and spend the day enjoying the scenery.\n","permalink":"https://blogbirdeyeview.github.io/posts/spain/granada/","summary":"Granada, Spain Travel date January 2023 Check other cities in Spain Exploring Andalucía Did you know Granada means Pomegranate in English?

Well, be sure to consider Tromso, Norway. I can not say enough incredible things about this small Scandinavian town. It is like driving around in a postcard. Every where you look, you are in nature’s paradise. Welcome to Tromso, Norway.\nTiming is Key In Tromso, the time of the year you travel is key. From the end of May until the end of July, Tromso has a Midnight Sun, which means that the sun never sets! On the other hand, from November to January comes the Polar Night and the sun never rises! Depending on your preferences, plan your trip wisely.\nMy trip was during the Polar Night Season.\nTIP: In the Polar Night season, the sun never appears, but from 9 am until about 1 pm, there is what seems like a sunrise, without the sun. There is a bit of light that peaks through. I recommend driving through the fjords during these hours to get incredible views and pictures.\nTraveling through Tromso While there are a few buses that pass through Tromso, it is most convenient to rent a car. It is fairly easy to drive in the city and most Airbnbs come with free parking. A car always you the opportunity to explore all the nature you want, whenever you want.\nTIP: Do not be afraid to drive in the snowy season. The cars are well made to handle the icy roads and snowy conditions.\nMake your way to the City Center Tromso city center is quite small, but very cute. It sits right along the water. There is a main street to walk through with many restaurants and shops. Be sure to buy a hotdog at the hotdog stand in the center. They are cheap and delicious! (Vegetarian hotdogs available)\nFood Tips Tromso city center is where you are going to find most of the restaurants in the region. CAUTION: Food and alcohol are very expensive in Tromso. We rarely ate at restaurants because of the high prices. I recommend going to the nearest grocery store and picking up some easy meals to cook in your Airbnb. (Even the grocery store has higher prices than normal.)\nA little outside the city center, you can find a cute café that overlooks a fjord. It is called Bryggejentene AS. Sip some coffee, have a pastry, and take in the amazing views.\nTIP: In Norwegian grocery stores, there are many limits on the alcohol they can sell. They only sell beer and ciders. Wines and liquors have to be bought at a liquor store.\nWhat to See There is not too much to visit in the city center. There are a few museums and churches, but the best of Tromso is in the nature.\nTromso Harbour Artic Cathedral The Polar Museum Fjellheisen We did not get a chance to go up this mountain, but the ratings are high. There is a cable car that takes you up to the mountain. Also, you can hike which takes about 45 minutes. From there, you can see views of Tromso and the fjords.\nFjords, Fjords, and more Fjords When traveling to Tromso, you really can’t miss the Fjords: They are everywhere! Depending on how many kilometers you have in your rental car, there are many places you can drive to to see incredible views. There are a few that I recommend, all within a 30–35-minute drive from the city center.\nGrotfjorden Tromvik (Viewpoint Waterfalls) Ersfjordbotn There are many parking stops along the roads to stop and take pictures. The listed sites are small villages that are created along the fjord. You can stop before the village and take more pictures along the way.\nTIP: Be careful not to park your car in the passing zone on the road. The roads are small, and sometimes that zone is necessary for cars to pass through.\nTIP: Hiking is also very popular, but not in the winter. The temperatures are extremely cold during the winter months and hiking is more difficult and dangerous. I recommend traveling in the spring or summer for the best hiking weather.\nDid someone say Northern Lights? The Northern Lights can be seen in Tromso from September until April. If you rent a car, I do not recommend taking a tour. It is much more convenient and comfortable searching for the lights on your own. The best time to see the lights is between 8 pm and 1 am. So, take a snack, your camera, and some warm clothes, and get hunting!\nWhere to look? Up! In order to see the Northern Lights, you must get out of the city center. Drive to one of the fjord locations listed above. But, do not enter the village because of the light. Stay outside the village and find a good place to park the car. Much of this night will be waiting. The Northern Lights are not something you can see all the time. They come and go. When they come, they may be visible for minutes or hours.\nClimate Conditions Matter Pay attention to the climate conditions before booking your trip. We traveled during a full moon, which really lighted up the sky, impeding our ability to see the Northern Lights clearly. The night must be clear and dark to see the dancing lights. I recommend staying in Tromso for at least 4-6 days in order to ensure your ability to see the Northern Lights at least once during your stay.\n","permalink":"https://blogbirdeyeview.github.io/posts/norway/tromso/","summary":"Tromso, Norway Travel date December 2022 Check other cities in Norway The Most Magical Place on Earth Ever thought about vacationing to one of the most northern points of the world?

Look no more. Take a short 2 hour train ride from Paris to Strasbourg! You can spend 2-3 days in Strasbourg. This small town has everything you need to take the weekend to relax and enjoy the scenery.\nStrolling through Strasbourg Unlike Paris, there are very few tourist attractions to see in Strasbourg. But, after Paris I needed a vacation from my vacation, so Strasbourg was perfect! Strasbourg is a very small town, and it is very manageable to walk everywhere you want to go. There are, however, 6 different tram lines that connect through the city. Strasbourg is on the border of France and Germany, so the town has a big German vibe.\nBEWARE: There are a lot less people who speak English in this town. But, the people seem to be kinder and more patient than in Paris\nHere are a few recommendations while strolling through Strasbourg:\nPetite-France: This is a really cute area of the town. It is a great photo-op right next to the river with beautiful buildings. You can take a walk alongside the river and admire the peacefulness of the town. There are many bridges that cross the river. Some famous bridges are Ponts Couverts and Barrage Vauban. Cathedral of Strasbourg Palace Rohan As I mentioned, there is not much to see as a tourist in Strasbourg. But, it is beautiful to take a walk through the town and explore the different streets.\nWalking over to Germany Why not kill two birds with one stone and touch another country on this trip? Germany is just about 5 km away from the center of Strasbourg. You can walk (which takes about 1 hour) or take the D tram from Strasbourg.\nGetting over the Border I recommend taking the D tram over the border to Germany. You can buy a ticket at the machine at the tram stop. Before getting go the tram, scan your ticket at the machine. Take the tram in the direction of Kehl Rathaus. You can get off at any of the last 2 stops. After getting off, use google maps to walk in the direction of the town near the river!\nDon’t worry, you do not need a passport! Germany and France are both in the European Union, so there is no border control between the two countries. Then, when you are ready to come back, I recommend crossing the Passerelle des Deux Rives bridge back into France. That way, you can say that you walked to another country!\nWhat to do in Germany You will enter into a town called Kehl, Germany. Honestly, there is not much to do in this town. It is not a tourist town. I recommend going to the grocery store and buying some German sweets. My favorite German chocolate is Ritter Sport. Also, buy a pretzel and coffee at a bakery! Other than that, you can walk around the town and relax the park right near the bridge.\nWARNING: When I went to Germany, the river between France and Germany had a very bad smell. I am not sure if this was a temporary problem or if it is normal. Don’t say I didn’t warn you!\nHungry for more? Here are some restaurants recommended by me and a friend who frequently travels to Strasbourg:\nOro Restaurant boutique: Latin American food. Very reasonably priced.\nTIP: Make sure to try the arepas! Tzatzi: Italian East Canteen Grand’Rue: Asian fusion Le Cyrano: (outside of the city center, near the train station) : has a little bit of everything and a cheap happy hour ","permalink":"https://blogbirdeyeview.github.io/posts/france/strasbourg/","summary":"Strasbourg, France Travel date January 2023 Check other cities in France Weekend in Strasbourg Looking for a short, quiet get away after your jam-packed trip to Paris? Look no more. Take a short 2 hour train ride from Paris to Strasbourg! You can spend 2-3 days in Strasbourg. This small town has everything you need to take the weekend to relax and enjoy the scenery.\nStrolling through Strasbourg Unlike Paris, there are very few tourist attractions to see in Strasbourg.","title":"Strasbourg, France"},{"content":" Paris, France Travel date January 2023 Check other cities in France Exploring Paris Welcome to Paris! The city of love. The fashion capital of the world. The home of delicious pastries, the Eiffel Tower, and tons of museums. For this trip, you need about 4-6 days. Pack your bags and Bon Vonyage!\nBest Views in Paris The best views of the city come from 2 places:\nLafayette Partners: This is a huge department store. Skip the shopping and go straight to the terrace! Spend some time taking in the view and taking some amazing pictures. The nice thing about Paris is that the buildings are not so high, so you can see the whole city! Within the department store there is also a cool stain glassed dome in the center to look up at. Basílica del Sacre Coeur: This is a cathedral in which you can go inside for free. I didn’t go inside the church because the view from that point is incredible. You can take the funicular up using a metro ticket (you’ll need another metro ticket if you want to take it down). You can also walk up the stairs. Make sure to walk around and take in the views when you get up there. There is a small garden and cute streets. Be aware of pickpockets! Bon Appétit! TIP: Try a sandwich from a sandwich shop! The menus usually come with a sandwich, drink, and a dessert for about 10-12 euros! Great deal and delicious!\nL’Annexe (outside Sainte-Chapelle) (cafe) La Cour de Rome (near Lafayette Partners) (cafe) Fresh Burritos saint - Lazare (near Lafayette Partners and Saint – Lazare metro station) (tacos) TIP: Be sure to eat lots of pastries! Especially Macarons and Merveilleuxs\nTIP: Do not pay more than 2 euros for a macaron! It’s not worth it. A cheaper macaron is just as delicious!\nMoving around Paris Public transportation is not as difficult as it looks. Try it out! Use google maps! The city is well connected by metro and bus. I never took a taxi or tour bus.\nIn the metro stations, there should be a machine to purchase tickets. Each ticket (ticket t+) is 2.10 euros. If you buy a bono of 10 ticket, it is 19.10 euros. The tickets can be used ONLY IN PARIS, in the bus, metro, RER, and T.\nTIP: These tickets cannot be used to go to the airports or to Versailles. You need a special ticket for these destinations. See more information on getting to Versailles.\nThe tickets are small and easy to lose. Don’t lose them! You are supposed to have 1 hour and 30 minutes to use the same tickets for a connection.\nBE ADVISED: Often, the machines where you pass through do not work. Also, you will often see people jumping over the rail for that reason.\nThe Eiffel Tower It is best to buy tickets in advance. You can also get them there, but you’ll have to wait in a longer line. You can enter through entrance 1 or entrance 2, there is no difference. Also, I think it’s best to get there first thing in the morning. There are less people, and you have more time after to explore the city!\nYou have 2 options. You can go to the 2nd floor (which also includes the 1st floor) or you can go to the top floor (which includes the 2nd and 1st floor)\n2nd floor access:\nAdults (25+): 18.10 euros (with elevator) Youth: (12-24) : 9 euros (with elevator) TIP: Take the elevator, there are a ton of stairs. You can always take the stairs down.\nTIP: You get a great view from the 2nd floor. I don’t think the top floor is worth it. Also, the top floor is often closed for events and weather conditions.\nTIP: It is really windy and cold when you go up. Come prepared. (Especially in the winter)\nThere are restaurants and cafes on the second and first floors. It is pretty expensive and not very good. But, the view is nice from the restaurant on the first floor. You can spend as much time as you want inside the tower.\nA nice place to see and take pictures of the Eiffel Tower is right across the street from it. It is called Place du Trocadero. It has the best view of the Eiffel Tower. It is great to visit at night when the tower is lit up. Every hour in the evening the Eiffel Tower has special lights that sparkle. This lasts for 5 minutes.\nView from Place du Trucadero\nPalace of Versailles To escape from the chaos of Paris, spend a day in the city of Versailles, just a little outside of Paris.\nGetting to Versailles Take the C train in direction to Versailles-Chateau Rive Gauche. Take the train until the end of the line.\nIMPORTANT: DO NOT get on the train without a special ticket. You need a special ticket to go to Versailles from Paris. This ticket costs about 7 euros round trip. You CANNOT use the normal Paris ticket. You can buy these in the machine or ask at the ticket counter. I repeat- DO NOT leave Paris without a special Versailles ticket.\nThe palace TIP: Get tickets in advance. They are 19.50 euros. Guests 18 years and under get in free. (Also any European resident 25 years and under can enter for free). I don’t recommend the audio guide unless you want to know EVERYTHING.\nVersailles is a big palace with many paintings, sculptures, and art inside. The most famous part to see is the Hall of Mirrors. I also recommend the gardens. In the winter, it’s not so beautiful. But I’m sure in the summer and spring it would be gorgeous. The gardens are free for everyone to walk through.\n","permalink":"https://blogbirdeyeview.github.io/posts/france/paris/","summary":"Paris, France Travel date January 2023 Check other cities in France Exploring Paris Welcome to Paris!

Start practicing your British accent and touch up on your British English dialect. Pro tip: Chips are French Fries and the lift is the elevator! I recommend at least 5 days in the city. London is a city that you can visit many times and always see something new.\nThe Underground, AKA: The Subway No need to fear! London is connected through undergrounds and busses! No need for a taxi, ever!\nLike most cities, if you want to take the train from the airport to the city, you will need a special ticket. You can buy that at the machines within the station. You may have to take a connection, but don’t worry, you can do it! Use google map: It becomes your best friend. If you mess up and go the wrong direction, just get off at the next stop and turn around and go the other direction!\nTIP: London undergrounds are REALLY underground and you will most likely not get any phone service below. So, make sure you know where you are going before you go under the ground.\nYou can pay the underground using your credit card (but it has to be a tap card) or Apple/google pay. This is the easiest and cheapest way to travel. Each traveler needs their own credit card, you cannot share. You will have to tap your card before and after getting on and off the underground. You don’t need to buy a ticket when inside of London (only for the airport). The cost of the trip will depend on how far you go and how many zones you travel through.\nTIP: Undergrounds run less frequently on the weekends, so plan ahead.\nTIP: Don’t be afraid of connections! It is very common to take a connection, and you most likely won’t have to leave the underground.\nLondon Attractions (An Outsider\u0026rsquo;s Persepctive) Of course, you can always pay to enter every building, but you are looking at making a dent in your bank account. So, why not take pictures from the outside? It’s free and beautiful! Here are some of my recommendations of what to see from an outsider’s perspective.\nChurches St. Paul’s Cathedral\nWestminster’s Abbey\nMonuments Big Ben\nParliament\nLondon Eye\nBuckingham Palace: You can see the changing of the guards throughout the day on the hour. The big event happens Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday at 11 am. I did not go to this event because I heard it was super crowded. Even watching the simple change was interesting!\nWestminster Bridge: I recommend crossing the bridge and walking along the river towards The London Eye. There are food trucks and street artists along the way. Then you can walk over the Hungerford Bridge which is only for pedestrians.\nParks St. James Park: Very peaceful park to walk through. There are many ducks, swans, and pigeons. Also, people often bring a bag of peanuts to feed the squirrels. Hyde Park: When you go to see Kensington Palace, you will be forced to walk through Hyde Park. You can spend hours in Hyde Park. Maybe even a picnic! Streets to Stoll Down Piccadilly Circus: Fun fact: it’s not actually a circus! It’s the “Times Square” of London! Many restaurants, stores, and people! Fun to walk down and people watch. Abbey Road Crossing ⁃ This is far from of all the tourist attractions, in zone 2 of London (recommendation: If you go to Madame Tussaud’s Museum, it is not too far from there)\n⁃ There is not much here! Just the famous street from the Beetles album cover. That’s it!\n⁃ Be careful! This street is not blocked off from traffic. Therefore, there are many cars that pass through and many dumb tourists who try to take a picture (my dad included). Very chaotic situation!\n⁃ There is a small store close to the studio. You cannot go inside the studio but you can take a picture from the outside.\n⁃ There are no other stores or restaurants near by, so get back on the underground!\nLondon Attractions (An Insider\u0026rsquo;s Persepctive) When traveling to London, I recommend paying for at least 2-3 attractions to go inside. Here are a few that I checked out from an insider\u0026rsquo;s perspective.\nTower of London I recommend buying tickets in advance BUT you will most likely still have to wait in line for at least 30 minutes. So, get there early before your ticket time. They don’t put you in line with accordance to your ticket time.\nAdult: 29.90 pounds Student: 24 pounds\nYou will most likely spend 1-2 hours inside. You can learn about the fortress and some English history. Also, there are many interactive activities for children inside.\nTower Bridge I recommend going up at least once in your life. You can take the stairs (caution there are a lot) or the elevator.\nTickets: Adults (16-59): 11.40 pounds Child (5-15): 5.70 pounds Student: 8.60 pounds Senior: (60+): 8.60 pounds\nKensington Palace I am not 100% convinced it was worth it to go inside. You can learn about the history of 3 royal kings and queens from the UK. It was a quick visit (30-40 minutes). The gardens are nice to walk around (those are free!) There is a Princess Diana memorial in the garden. And of course, take pictures of the palace from the outside.\nTickets: Adult: 16 pounds Student: 12.80 pounds Child: 8 pounds\nMadame Tussaud\u0026rsquo;s London The wax museum! There are wax figures of many famous people, including actors, singers, political figures, Marvel characters, etc. Very fun for all ages. Unfortunately, when we went it was way overcrowded. Try to go during an off season for tourism. You can buy tickets in advance or get them at the door. I recommend the standard ticket. There is so much to see, without the extra add ons.\nTickets: Adults: 37 pounds Child: 33.50 pounds\nFueling your Body Harrison’s coffee (near Kensington Palace) (Chilean restaurant)\nBar and Block Steakhouse Aldgate (near the London Tower) (steak and fish)\nThe Ivy City Garden (near the London Tower) (fish and seafood and burgers)\nTIP: Pubs are a great vibe for drinking, but the food quality and staff service are not great. Drink a few pints at the pub and have dinner at another restaurant\n","permalink":"https://blogbirdeyeview.github.io/posts/england/london/","summary":"London, England Travel date December 2022 Check other cities in England London Here We Come Welcome to London!
