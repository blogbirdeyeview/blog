[{"content":" Gibraltar, UK Travel date May 2023 Check other cities in United Kingdom Looking to check two countries off in one European trip? While in Spain, head down south to Gibraltar, a commonwealth of England. Gibraltar is 3 hours from Granada, 2 hours from Malaga, and about 7 hours from Madrid (all in car). I recommend taking a day trip while in Andalucía to see what the city is all about.\nGetting to Gibraltar While there are buses that will take you to Gibraltar from major Andalusian cities, I recommend renting a car for the day. It is a whole lot faster and more convenient. You can even make stops in several Andalusian cities along the way.\nI recommend parking the car before crossing the border. There is a parking lot very close to the border that costs about 2 euros per hour. Once you park, walk on over to the border control.\nAlert: BRING YOUR PASSPORT. You are leaving Spain and entering the United Kingdom. They will stamp your passport as you walk across.\nTake the bus right across the border to get to the center of the city and the cable car. It is cheaper to buy a round trip ticket if you know that you will want to take the bus back. Just don’t lose your ticket!\nTIP: In Gibraltar they use both euros and pounds. So, as long as you have one of the following you will be fine.\nTIP: Buses have discounts for seniors over 60 years old. Be sure to ask for that.\nWhile Gibraltar is part of the United Kingdom, and the official language is English, many people also speak Spanish. In fact, most bus drivers are Spanish speaking but will understand some English.\nA Day Across the Border In my opinion, you only need 1 day in Gilbratar. I do not recommend staying the night. I got there at 5 pm and left at 9 pm. That was enough time to do what I wanted to do. The city center itself is very small. There are restaurants and small shops to explore.\nGibraltar City Center The big attraction is the rock of Gibraltar. You cannot miss it. It is a huge rock that overlooks the city. There are several ways to make it to the top. You can take the cable car, a bus tour, or walk. The first option might put a dent in your wallet. The cable car is 19 pounds for an adult, 9 pounds for a child (5-11) and 17 pounds for a senior (65+). There are many things that the rock offers, like museums, monuments, a nature reserve, castles, WWII Tunnels, and bridges. But, if you were like me, you may be only interested in one thing - seeing the monkeys!\nIf you are interested in only seeing the monkeys, I recommend walking. It is free and not too high up. You don’t need to go all the way to the top of the rock. You will follow a path up hill. Along the way you can take plenty of rests and soak up the incredible scenery. There are maps on the path to guide you to what you want to see.\nDon’t monkey around Here are a few warnings when seeing the monkeys.\nFirst, it is important to know that the monkeys are not in cages, they are free. But, do not touch them. They do not want to be touched and might feel threatened. Posing Monkeys Next, do not feed them. They are given food by the workers so there is no need to give them anything else.\nAlso, keep your bags close and visible to you at all times. Sometimes the monkeys will open your bags, looking for food, and they might take some of your stuff, including wallets and passports. So, be careful.\nFinally, do not bring your dogs near the monkeys. They feel threatened by dogs and start to get in attack mode. Just enjoy the monkeys! Be sure to take lots of pictures.\nSleepy Monkey ","permalink":"https://blogbirdeyeview.github.io/posts/uk/gibraltar/","summary":"Gibraltar, UK Travel date May 2023 Check other cities in United Kingdom Looking to check two countries off in one European trip?

Here you will find people speaking Spanish AND Basque (Euskera). The Basque language is very different from Spanish and any other language. But, no worries. Everyone in the city center will also speak Spanish and some even English. So… pack your bags and welcome to Bilbao.\nArrival Welcome to Bilbao Bilbao is in the north of Spain, about 400 kilometers from Madrid. You can fly into Bilbao’s airport (with a connection) or take a bus or train from Madrid. From the airport, take bus A3247 to the city center for only 3 euros. It is quick and leaves every 15 minutes.\nTIP: If you have a late check-in to your hotel or Airbnb, you can store your luggage in a locker at the Bilbao bus station (Bilbao Intermodal). The airport bus will take you to the bus station at its last stop. The lockers cost about 5 euros for 1 day. It is a large locker that can fit several backpacks or a large suitcase. There is a machine that will assign you a locker and you must pay with a credit card. (EXTRA TIP: Take a picture of the code that the machine gives you. You will need that code to open up your locker.)\nTIP: On your way back to the airport, be sure to use your Barik card to pay on the bus. It will cost you only 50 cents instead of the 3 euros. It is almost impossible to do this on the way there because there are no machines in the airport to buy a Barik card. But, if you are a returning visitor to Bilbao, be sure to use your Barik card for your roundtrip.\nPhoto Opportunities San Mames Stadium: Any soccer fans out there? Stop by San Mames Stadium to take a picture in front of Bilbao’s home stadium. There are also shops and a museum to really soak in the sport’s atmosphere.\nErrukiaren Parkea: Beautiful park close to the San Mames Stadium. Relax in the shade and listen to the calming sounds of the fountain.\nDoña Casilda de Iturrizar Park: The first thing I noticed about Bilbao was all the green in the city. So many trees, grass, and flowers. Walk through this amazing park to admire the various fountains, sculptures, flowers, and ponds. TIP: Buy some ready-made food from a nearby supermarket (for example, Mercadona) and take it to this park to have a small picnic. There is plenty of shade and space to relax.\nDoña Casilda de Iturrizar Park Plaza de Don Federico Moyúa: This huge roundabout is actually a plaza! Walk around and take pictures with the gorgeous flowers and big fountain. Beware, this plaza does not have much shade, so the sun can be very powerful. Spring Flowers at the Plaza Mirador de Artxanda: Lookout over all of Bilbao. Take the funicular to this incredible view. The funicular station is located at the bottom and is called “Estación del Funicular de Artxanda”. You can use your Barik transport card and the ticket will be about 30 cents. The funicular comes every 15 minutes. Once you are up there, you can relax, take pictures, and walk around. Then come back down whenever you are ready. (You have to pay a return ticket as well) TIP: There is also a hiking trail if you wish to hike there. It takes about 45 minutes to an hour. But, beware, it is very high up! Getting Around Bilbao is a very hilly city. There are many ups and downs. While you can walk wherever you need to go, there are also options of transportation that you should take advantage of.\nMetro: There are 3 metro lines: L1, L2, L3\nBus: Many buses that will get you to where you need to go.\nFunicular: There are 3 funiculars to reach the top of big hills\nEuskotren: 3 trains that go a little bit outside of the city center.\nTranvía: 1 train that runs through the city center.\nTren Renfe: 5 trains that pass through different zones. This train will be more expensive than the rest.\nWhile it can be confusing on which transportation to take, rely on your google maps. Put in your destination and google will tell you which transportation to take.\nTIP: I recommend getting the Barik transport card. This can be bought in the metro stations or a Tobacco store. The card costs 3 euros and needs a minimum of 5 euros credit, so 8 euros total. This card can be used on any Bilbao transportation. The same one card can also be used by several people in your group (up to 10 people).\nBeach Day While Bilbao is generally a little colder than the rest of Spain, there are still plenty of opportunities to spend a day at the beach on a sunny day.\nI recommend getting on the metro and heading to the beach. There are several beaches to choose from, however, since Bilbao is a port city, some beaches may not be so beautiful. I recommend heading a little outside of Bilbao to Plentzia Beach. You can get there by taking the Plentzia metro line all the way to the end of the line. The total trip will take about an hour. You can use your Barik transport card and the whole trip will cost you less than a euro. After you get off the metro, you can cross the bridge and walk along the coast for about 15 to 20 minutes to arrive at the beach. The sand at the beach is very clean and not rocky. Warning: There are no umbrellas or chairs to rent. The whole beach is directly in the sun. After taking a dip, walk around the small city center near the beach to get a bite to eat or an ice cream.\nPlentzia Dock The Downtown Take a day to explore the historical center of Bilbao. Walk through the enchanting streets and soak in all the Spanish vibes. Walk along the river and admire the beautiful bridges in the city. Here are some stops to make along the way.\nColorful Houses of Bilbao Mercado de La Ribera: Next to the river you can find Bilbao’s big market. Inside you can eat, drink, and relax. In Bilbao they are famous for their pintxos, which is a piece of bread with basically any combination on top, including seafood, meat, Spanish tortilla, olives, and cheese.\nIglesia San Antón: Next to the market, admire this historical church. Unfortunately, it does not make for a great photo because there are almost always people sitting on the steps, smoking cigarettes and drinking beer. But, it is still a pretty church to see.\nCatedral De Santiago de Bilbao: From afar, you will be able to look up and see a big cross coming out of this tall cathedral. However, when you get up close, it is a little harder to see. The cathedral is surrounded by buildings and restaurants. But, you can go inside for 6 euros to see this 14th century cathedral.\nPlaza Nueva: Almost every big city in Spain has a plaza nueva, and this one is no different. It is a big plaza surrounded by restaurants and shops. Stop by to see a traditional Spanish plaza.\nNervión River: Walk along Bilbao\u0026rsquo;s river until you get to Guggenheim\u0026rsquo;s Museum. The river is beautiful and the bridges are impressive.\nNervión River Guggenheim’s Museum: Even if you are not a museum person, be sure to walk around this one. The architecture of the building is incredible and iconic. Be sure to see the sculptures of the flowered dog behind the building and the enormous spider in front. The museum is an art museum. Tickets are 16 euros for adults, free for children up to 17 years old, 8 euros for students 18 to 26 years old, and 8 euros for adults over 65 years old. Flowered Dog Day Trip Have an extra day to spare? Take a day trip to Santander, a small city about 1 ½ hours from Bilbao.\nTake a short bus ride (Alsa bus) from Bilbao to Santander. You can leave in the morning and come back in the evening. The bus ride costs about 15 euros round trip.\nOnce you get to Santander, walk around the city center (which is near the bus station). It is a small city center, but there are a few stops you should make.\nSantander’s Cathedral\nParque de las Cachavas\nPaseo Marítimo de Santander (Seaside walking area) TIP: If you are looking for an ice cream break, be sure to stop at Via Mazzini. Delicious ice cream for a reasonable price.\nAfter seeing the center, head on over to the seafront. It is a pretty long walk, but if you make some stops along the way, it should be no problem.\nBe sure to walk through Túnel de Tetúan. It is an old tunnel that recently opened for pedestrians. It is on the way to the beach and is super cool to walk through.\nEl Sardinero: Beautiful beach! The water is so clear and the sand is very clean.\nSardinero Beach Jardines de Piquio: Near the beach there is a small garden that overlooks the sea. It is gorgeous and a nice place to relax and listen to the waves.

Welcome to Málaga! The birthplace of Pablo Picasso! Spend about 2 days exploring this fantastic Andalusian city. Enjoy the seafood, paella, and everything else that this city has to offer.\nTravel in Málaga Airport Málaga has an international airport! The airport is located about 20 minutes outside of Málaga center. There is a train (Renfe C1) or bus (Alsa) that can take you to the center from the airport. There are also buses that can take you from Málaga airport to nearby cities like Granada, Sevilla, or Marbella.\nMálaga Airport Metro While Málaga is a walkabout city, it also has 2 metro lines. You can buy a metro card at one of the stations and take the metro to wherever you need to go. (One metro card can be used for multiple passengers)\nBus You can also hop on any bus to get to your destination. You can pay on the bus with cash. Each ticket within the city will cost 1.40 euros.\nTrain To get outside of Málaga center to a nearby city, use trains C1 and C2. These trains have special tickets, which you can buy in the station. Or you can use your credit card to tap at the gate. (Each passenger needs their own ticket or their own credit card).\nCity Center Attractions Málaga is home to MANY museums. You can find art museums, history museums, wine museums, and soccer museums.\nRoman Theatre: Marvel at the ruins of this ancient Roman monument. It is believed to be one of Europe’s oldest theaters, dating back to the first century.\nMálaga’s Cathedral: Yes, like most Spanish cities, Málaga has a huge cathedral! It’s located in the heart of the city center, you can’t miss it!\nMálaga Cathedral Pablo Picasso Museum: See Picasso’s art work in his hometown! Tickets are 9.50 euros and 7.50 euros for students under 26 years old and adults over 65 years old. Free entry for children under 17 years old and people with disabilities. Shop til you drop Málaga center is filled with stores. Some of my favorites include Mango, Springfield, and Zara.\nSeaside Activities Málaga is a port city, so be sure to bring your bathing suit and sunscreen and head to the beach!\nBecause Málaga is a port city, the beaches in the center are not the best for swimming. But, close by you can find a large selection of beaches to test out.\nTake a stroll along the pier. Along the pier you will find various restaurants, ice cream shops, and stores. Enjoy the beautiful views and opportunities to soak in the Mediterranean sun.\nParque de Málaga: Near the pier is a beautiful park to walk through. Enjoy the flowers, fountains, and monuments.\nUp, Up, and Away If you are looking for more of an active day, you can hike up to a lookout (or take a taxi). The lookouts are called Mirador de Gibralfaro and Mirador de la Coracha. The hike from the center takes about 30 minutes. You can take the stairs which are more direct or get there by a gradual ascend which takes longer but is easier on the body. I recommend the gradual ascend, you can take stops along the way and most of it is in the shade. Then you can take the stairs down. The gradual incline path starts next to the Roman Theatre. If you choose the stairs, they start near Parque de Málaga.\nMálaga from Mirador de Gibralfaro While up on the hill, take a tour of the Gibraltaro Castle and Alcazaba. The alcazaba was a palace home to Muslim rulers in the 11th century. The Gibraltaro Castle was built in the 14th century to protect the Alcazaba. Tickets to visit both the castle and Alcazaba are 5.50 euros. If you choose just to visit one of the monuments, it is 3.50 euros.\nDay trips outside Málaga Torremolinos: If you are looking for a beach day, take the C1 train to Torremolinos, a nearby city in the region of Málaga. Here you can find plenty of beaches, fantastic restaurants, and a cute center to stroll through. This is one of my favorite cities because it is a little less hectic than Málaga and has wonderful beaches to relax. TIP: If you have an early flight out of Málaga, I recommend staying in Torremolinos the night before. It is close to the airport and you can take a day to relax by the beach before your long journey.\nRonda: Take a 2 hour bus to Ronda, a city between Málaga and Sevilla. This is one of my favorite cities in Spain. It is super small, so you only need a day or two. This town has an old, historical vibe and offers great photo opportunities. Take a walk through the streets and take in the scenic views.\nMarbella: Marbella is about 1 hour from Málaga. Marbella is the oo-la-la city of Andalucía. Here you will find luxury stores, bars, clubs, and yachts. If you are looking to party like a king, Marbella is your place to be.\nCaminito del Rey: About 1 hour away from Málaga. A fantastic hiking path with spectacular views. This path is more than 100 meters above the ground. The path is one way, so there is no turning back. You need to book a ticket in advance. Tickets are 10 euros for general entry and 18 euros if you want a guide. Tickets sell out fast, so make sure to book far in advance. The hike takes between 2 and 3 hours.\n","permalink":"https://blogbirdeyeview.github.io/posts/spain/malaga/","summary":"Málaga, Spain Travel date May 2023 Check other cities in Spain ¡Bienvenidos a Málaga!

Be sure to check the weather before making your trip! But, there are activities to do all year long in this wonderful city.\nChicago City Center Transportation Chicago is home to the “L”, the elevated train. The “L” is like a subway, but most of it is above the streets, connected by bridges. There are also stations that are below ground. The “L” can connect you to different parts of the city.\nChicago is also a very walkable city because most of the tourist destinations are centralized and close together. The streets are easy to follow. If you get lost, look up and find the Willis Tower as a point of reference!\nUbers and taxis are also common to take in Chicago. They are pricey, but may be worth it if you are traveling with other people.\nMuseum Hub Chicago is a museum hub!

Yes, a big glass bean. Sounds… interesting. Take your classic mirror picture with the bean and enjoy a stroll through the park. Traveling in winter? Be sure to rent some ice skates and go ice skating at Millennium Park or the Ice Skating Ribbon at Maggie Daley Park, which is located right across the bridge. The Bean TIP: As an ice skater myself, I recommend Maggie Daley Park rather than Millennium Park. It is a bigger space and you do not feel as crowded. Both are great for beginner skaters and the more experienced. TIP: Ice rink admission is almost always free, but you must pay for skates. You can always bring your own skates if you have them. (There are some hours and days when a small fee applies)\nWillis Tower: Looking to see Chicago from a bird’s eye view? Take the elevator up to the Sky Deck in the Willis Tower, the third tallest building in the USA. Hope you are not afraid of heights as you look over the city from the glass ledge.

If you’re lucky, you can find free street parking a few blocks away.\nBeaches Chicago can be extremely hot in the summer, so be sure to pack your bathing suit and relax at one of Chicago’s beaches. No, Chicago is not connected to an ocean. It is a HUGE lake, called Lake Michigan. This lake touches four states, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin. The lakefront touching Chicago is not the cleanest water, but that does not seem to stop people from swimming!\nNorth Avenue Beach: One of Chicago’s most popular beaches\nOak Street Beach: Close to downtown and The Magnificent Mile\nOhio Street Beach: Right next to Navy Pier\n12th Street Beach: Close to the Adler Planetarium, away from the city center\nFor the Early Risers Seeing the sunrise over Lake Michigan is by far my favorite thing about Chicago. So, here’s the plan. Step 1. Be sure to look up when the sun rises. Also, it is very important to go on a clear day. Depending on the season, you may be waking up VERY early and if it is a cloudy day, you won’t see the sunrise. Step 2. Pack a coffee, blanket, and snack. Step 3. Drive on Lake Shore Drive until West Fullerton Ave. Step 4. You can find street parking for free near the Lincoln Park Zoo. Step 5. Walk toward the lakefront, near the theater on the lake. Step 6. Take amazing pictures, a time lapse, drone videos, and enjoy the peaceful and amazing sunrise. Trust me, it is 100% worth it.\nDrone View of Chicago at Sunrise Chicago Sunrise over Lake Michigan Food Tour Hungry for more? Get ready to experience Chicago’s diverse food options all throughout the city.

Basically, it is a hot dog with everything on it, BESIDES ketchup. Enjoy the tomatoes, onion, mustard, relish, and peppers, but forget about the ketchup. You can buy a hotdog at many small hot dog shops or even a food cart on the side of the street.\nChicago Style Deep Dish Pizza: This pizza will make all the Italians out there start a riot. Chicago has found a way to make pizza even more unhealthy. By adding another pound of cheese! This pizza looks like a pie, and can be quite intimidating to eat. Beware, this pizza is very filling. Feelings are split about it’s taste: you either love it or hate it! Give it a try! Famous restaurants for deep dish pizza are Lou Malnati’s and Giordano’s Pizzeria.\nItalian Beef Sandwich: Enjoy a delicious sandwich filled with shredded Italian beef and peppers. A popular restaurant for a classic Italian beef sandwich is Portillo’s.\nGarrett Popcorn: Are you a popcorn lover like myself? Stop by Garrett Popcorn Shop to try different flavors of sweet and salty popcorn.

I recommend renting a bike for the day to ride around the island.\nTIP: Wheel Fun Rentals - Coronado Island is a good place to rent bikes!\nPacific Beach: Nice beach surrounded by many restaurants, stores, and ice cream shops. The beach is about 15 minutes by car from the center, and 50 minutes using public transportation. TIP: Pacific Beach is relatively close to Old Town, San Diego. So, if you plan on spending the morning in Old Town, spend the afternoon at the beach!\nPacific Beach Exploring the City San Diego is relatively small, compared to Los Angeles and San Francisco. Take advantage of the small town vibes by walking around and exploring the different neighborhoods.\nWaterfront Park Little Italy: Ciao! Be sure to stop for gelato and pizza, every day!\nOld Town: Old Town, San Diego is located a tad outside of the city center. You can get there by train. Walk around and explore the shops and houses of the first European settlement in California. Being so close to Mexico, San Diego is home to authentic Mexican culture and delicious food. In Old Town, you can see the town’s Mexican heritage through the handcrafted items sold from Mexico.\nGaslamp Quarter: Neighborhood in San Diego home to entertainment, shopping, and nightlife.\nUSS Midway Museum: Learn about San Diego’s naval community on this decommissioned aircraft carrier. The general admission price is pretty expensive ($31 for adults and $21 for children). It is also great to take a picture from the outside and take a virtual free tour on their website!\nUSS Midway Balboa Park: Gorgeous and gigantic park! Filled with museums, restaurants, gardens, fountains, and the San Diego Zoo. You can walk to Balboa Park, but it is an uphill battle. Also, you can take a bus!\nSan Diego Zoo: The first zoo to introduce open air exhibits, encouraging natural animal habitat. One of the only places outside China where you can see Giant Pandas!\nCoronado Orange Avenue: While exploring the island of Coronado, make sure to walk up and down Orange Avenue, which is the main street filled with shops and restaurants.\nTIP: The ferry to Coronado starts at 9:00 am from San Diego and takes a trip to Coronado every hour, on the hour. The ferry from Coronado to San Diego starts at 9:30 am and leaves every hour, on the half hour. The last ferry leaves San Diego at 9:00 pm Sunday through Thursday and 10:00 pm Friday and Saturday. The last ferry leaves from Coronado at 9:30pm Sunday through Thursday and 10:30 pm Friday and Saturday. The ferry is $7 per person one way.\nEmbarcadero Marina Park South: A great place to see the Coronado Bridge. I recommend going to watch the sunset! Where to Dine One downside to San Diego is its expensive food prices. But, there are some hidden gems that you can find that are delicious and cheap. I recommend eating a big lunch rather than a big dinner. Sometimes restaurants offer lunch deals, but rarely will you see dinner deals.\nDowntown San Diego The Taco Stand\nDonut Bar: Huge donuts (can be shared) that are expensive but delicious.\nOrtiz’s: The best taco stop\nHodad’s: The best burger spot\nMister A’s: $$$$ Expensive, but delicious!\nOld Town, San Diego Casa Guadalajara: Great Mexican restaurant in Old Town, San Diego.

Welcome to the capital of Chile, Santiago. No matter where you plan to travel within Chile, you will most likely always pass through Santiago. Why not stay a few days to explore?\nTransportation in Santiago The best way to get around Santiago is by the subway. There are plenty of different subway lines that will get you to anywhere you need to go within the city. You can buy a “Bip” card within any subway station. When on the subway, be aware of theft. Try not to take out your phone too much and remember to keep your bag in front of you. Also, it is very likely that you will see people selling items on the train, such as candies, electronics, or small household items. In Chile it is illegal to sell items on the train and illegal to purchase items. So, I would stay clear of these people and politely decline.\nTouring Santiago Santiago, like many capital cities, requires A LOT of walking. So, put on your walking shoes and your smart watch to track your steps. Be sure to check out these major tourist attractions.\nSanta Lucia: Bring your walking shoes to hike up the hill of Santa Lucia. At the top you’ll get incredible views of the city. Santa Lucia is what remains of a old volcano in Chile. Enjoy the neat architecture as you climb up to 69 meter/230 feet top point. Santa Lucia Plaza de Armas: Stop buy this beautiful plaza while exploring Santiago. Within the plaza you can find statues, cathedrals, government buildings, street art, and so on.\nCerró San Cristóbal: Yes, another hill! This hill is more like a mountain! Of course, you can hike up this hill, but I recommend taking the funicular. It is super cheap and you get incredible views on your way up. On the top of San Cristóbal, you can enjoy a beautiful view of Santiago, along with famous Christian statues and a small chapel. On this hill, you can also find the famous Chilean National Zoo and a Japanese garden.\nCostanera Center: A SUPER tall mall located just outside the city center. This building happens to be the second tallest building in Latin America, and the largest shopping mall in Latin America. You can take the elevator up to Sky Costanera to get a complete view of Santiago. Tickets cost 12,000 peso for adults and 5,000 pesos for children Monday to Thursday, while Friday to Sunday it is 16,000 pesos for adults and free for children.\nLa Moneda Palace: This is where the Chilean president works and this building holds a lot of history. You can book a tour of the building, but I recommend taking pictures from the outside.\nMercado Central: Walk through the biggest market of Santiago. Buy different pastries, breads, cheeses, and typical Chilean dishes.\nCatedral Metropolitana de Santiago: Beautiful cathedral located in Plaza de Armas. Free entry and very spiritual feeling inside.\nTemplo Baha’i de Sudamérica: Beautiful architecture of this nondenominational temple. From the entrance to the temple, be prepared for a long, steep walk. There is also a shuttle that can take you to the temple for a small fee.\nOutside Santiago Feeling adventurous? Take a few day trips outside of the city center to get a taste of Chile\u0026rsquo;s incredible nature and activity options.\nCajón del Maipo: Rent a car for the day and take a trip to Cajón del Maipo. Enjoy the beautiful mountains, lakes, and waterfalls. Take a hiking trip, or even go rafting! TIP: The winter in Chile is between the months of June and August. There will most likely be snow in the mountains during these months.\nEmbalse el Yeso: Just a little farther than Cajón del Maipo you can find this beautiful dam among the mountains. Enjoy more incredible scenery as you escape from the fast paced city life.\nFantasilandia: Traveling with kids? Or do you have the spirit of a kid? Take a trip to Chile’s biggest amusement park. You can take public transportation to get to this park. The price of the park depends on how tall you are! Prices range between 9,990 to 18,990 pesos. Enter free for those under 90 cm.\nAgua de la Ramón: Take the metro and a short uber to this ecological park.

As you step foot in Spain’s capital, be sure to pack your walking shoes. Get ready to explore one of Spain’s most cultural cities.\nExploring the Attractions There is a lot to see and do in Madrid, but luckily everything is located relatively close together in the city center. That’s not to say that you won’t be walking at least 15,000 steps a day. But no need to fear. Madrid is also connected by subways and buses. All you need is a transportation card (which you can buy at any subway station).\nFor the museum enthusiasts Madrid is Spain’s hub of museums. If you’re like me, you may find museums a bit of a drag. But, there are plenty of options to attract all of your interests. So, if you happen to have a rainy day in Madrid, or you are looking to absorb artistic culture, check out these options.\nMuseo del Prado (famous art museum in Spain known especially for its Velázquez paintings)\nMuseo de Reina Sofía (contemporary art museum)\nTIP: If you are a student or teacher, check for discounts! And always travel with your student or teacher ID\nFor those who enjoy strolls in the park Like many European cities, Madrid is filled with parks, both big and small, to spend a nice afternoon.\nEl Retiro: huge park near the Prado museum. Be sure to bring your walking shoes. You can spend hours roaming around the park. There is even a small pond inside if you’d like to rent a paddle boat\nCampo del Moro: Beautiful garden behind the Royal Palace.\nMirador de la Montaña de Príncipe Pío: This is a beautiful lookout over the city of Madrid. There is also a park to walk through and the temple of Debod (Spain’s only Egyptian temple) which you can visit.

Valparaíso and Viña del Mar are only about 2 hours in bus from Santiago. They are right next to each other, so you can experience them both. Here, you can find miles of beaches, colorful street art, and amazing culture. Welcome to Valparaíso and Viña Del Mar.\nStreet art in Valparaíso Transportation in Valpo/Viña Viña Del Mar and Valparaíso are connected by a metro. All you need to do is buy a metro card which can be bought in any metro station.\nUnfortunately, the metro will not get you to many tourist attractions. There is also a bus system that can help.\nThe bus system in Chile is a bit complicated. While there are bus stops, a bus will most likely stop anywhere you are if you lift up your hand to signal the bus driver. Once on the bus, you can pay the bus driver. They only accept cash or coins (small bills). A bus trip will usually cost less than 1 dollar. There is no special bus card and you cannot pay with a credit card. Once you pay, find a seat or hold on because the bus will start moving, fast! Bus drivers in Chile are crazy. They drive super fast and sometimes even with the doors open. If you want to get off the bus, you have to touch the button and get off quick when the bus stops.\nTIP: Be careful of theft on buses and metros. Try not to take out your phone and make sure to keep your purse or backpack in front of you.\nTIP: There are many people that come into the bus and metro to try to sell small items like candies or drinks. This is illegal in Chile, but it happens all the time. It is also illegal to buy from them. I would recommend not buying from these people.\nFor the Beach Bums Looking for a relaxing day at the beach? Want to learn how to surf? Hoping to see a beautiful sunset over the ocean? Look no more! Viña del Mar and Valparaíso are both costal cities that will satisfy your vacation plans. Valparaíso is the major port of Chile, so the beaches are better for swimming a little bit more north in Viña and Reñaca.\nTIP: In Chile, the seasons are opposite of the Northern Hemisphere. So, the summer season is from December-March. Spend a Christmas on the beach!\nAlong the Coast Castillo Wulff: Beautiful castle that overlooks the ocean. Stop and take pictures and walk around.\nMuelle Vergara: Enjoy a beautiful sunset from this dock. Walk along the beach and dip your toes in the water.\nReñaca beaches: Reñaca is another city close to Viña Del Mar. These beaches tend to be cleaner and more popular for swimming. There are also many restaurants near by!\nSunset over the Pacific Ocean Dunas de Concón: Spend the afternoon hiking up the sand dunes! I recommend renting a sand board and going sand boarding (like snow boarding but on sand!). Stay to watch the gorgeous sunset over the ocean.\nPlaya La Boca Concon: This beach is super popular for surfing. Rent a surfboard and suit for a very reasonable price.\nPlaya Las Cujas: Beautiful beach about an hour and a half north of Viña del Mar\nTIP: Many beaches in Chile have stray dogs wondering around. They are usually harmless, but give them food or pet them and they might follow you home. Also, watch out for dog poop on the beach!\nFor the outdoorsy people Jardín Botánico Nacional de Viña Del Mar: Take a bus ride out to Viña’s botanical garden. There is a small entry fee. Spend the day enjoying the beautiful nature and wildlife inside. Jardín Botánico Nacional Laguna Sausalito: Take a stroll around this gorgeous lagoon. Right outside Viña center.\nQuinta Vergara: Roam around this park in Viña Del Mar. There is a museum inside the park and a concert stadium where they hold the famous Viña Del Mar concert every summer.\nPaseo 21 de Mayo de Valparaíso: Valparaíso is the city of hills! It’s like the San Francisco of Chile. Paseo 21 de Mayo is a lookout that overlooks the port of Valparaíso. You can walk or take the funicular.\nWhat more? Reloj de Flores de Viña Del Mar: Right in between Viña and Valparaíso is a flower clock! And the clock works!\nCasa Museo La Sebastiana: Enter one of Pablo Neruda’s houses and learn about the Chilean poet’s life.\nEscalera Piano: Take a picture with these famous piano painted stairs. Walk around and enjoy the incredible street art painted on the buildings.\nPiano stairs For the Wine-Os In my unbiased opinion, Chile is home to the best wine in the world. Take a day trip exploring the vineyards of Casablanca. Unfortunately, there is no public transportation that will bring you to a vineyard. You will have to arrange a tour, take a taxi, or rent a car.\nOnce you are in the region of Casablanca, you have many options for different vineyards. Each one will offer a tour and tasting. Tours and tastings are relatively cheap and quite interesting. Tours are usually offered in Spanish or English.\nI recommend not buying a bottle of wine at the vineyard. It will most likely be expensive. But, do not leave Chile without bringing a bottle or two of wine in your suitcase. Fantastic wine can be bought at any local grocery store.\nWine Cellar A comer You cannot leave Chile without having at least 10 empanadas. My favorite are oven baked empanadas, but many prefer the fried ones. Either way, be sure to try the “pino” empanada. This is the traditional empanada of Chile that contains onion, beef, egg, and a black olive. Not your taste? No worries. There are plenty of options, from seafood to vegetables to fruit, that will be sure to satisfy everyone.\nBe sure to embrace the culture with a Piscola or Pisco Sour. Pisco is the national liquor of Chile and is traditionally mixed with Coca Cola or made into a lemon cocktail.\nRestaurants recommended by friends and myself:\nJarBar Viña: rooftop bar\nHelados Coletti: Delicious ice cream\nTierra de Fuego: Fancy restaurant near the coast\nIdílico Restobar: Pizzas, burgers, and big mojitos\nRockola Diner: Typical American diner\nCafé Journal: Seafood\nA Mano Gin and Burgers: Burgers\nPizzeria Ecuador: Fantastic pizza\nDelicias Express: Empanadas\n","permalink":"https://blogbirdeyeview.github.io/posts/chile/valparaiso/","summary":"Valpo/Viña, Chile Travel date March 2020 Check other cities in Chile Street Art Capital of Chile When traveling to Chile, don’t miss out on the exciting coastal cities of Valparaíso and Viña Del Mar.

With this card you can enter all the museums and castles, go on a boat tour and enter the famous Tívoli park for a single price. That being said, you have to be an ambitious person to try to see as much as you can (paid attractions) within the 24 hours.

Welcome to Granada! Granada is located in the southern part of Spain, called Andalucía. Here, you will hear people speaking Spanish! In the tourist center, you can find people who speak English in some shops and restaurants. Granada is home to the most visited attraction in Spain, the Alhambra.\nArriving at Granada Granada is a small city in Spain with a population of only about 200,000. There are several ways to arrive to Granada.\nAirplane: Granada has a small “international” airport. While it is international, the only countries you can travel directly to are England and France. But, you can take a connection flight from Madrid or Barcelona. The closest bigger airport is in Malaga, Spain. From Malaga, you can take a train or bus to Granada, which takes about 2 hours. Bus: Granada is connected to many Spanish cities by bus. A popular bus company is called Alsa. Train: Granada has a train station directly in the city center! The company is called Renfe. The train to and from Granada will only take you inside of Spain. If you are coming from outside of Spain, you will need to take a few connections. Deciding on when to travel When planning your trip to the south of Spain, be sure to consider the weather conditions. Granada is extremely hot in the summer months: June, July, and August. Temperatures can reach over 40 degrees Celsius / 104 degrees Fahrenheit on a daily basis.\nThe winter months: December, January, and February have moderate temperatures, the minimum reaching about -5 degrees Celsius / 23 degrees Fahrenheit. In Granada, you almost never see snow in the center, but you will most likely see snow in the Sierra Nevada mountains. Granada is a mostly sunny region, so pack your sunscreen and your sunglasses, even in the winter!\nLos Miradores (Lookouts) The best part about Granada is all of its incredible views. Granada is a hilly city, so bring your walking shoes and get ready to put in about 20,000 steps a day!\nTIP: It is easy to get “lost” in the streets of Granada. They were designed that way to run away from invaders! But, most streets are connected, so don’t worry. Use google maps, ask someone you see, and just explore! Roaming through the narrow streets of Granada is the best way to experience the city.\nThe best lookouts Mirador San Nicolas / Patio de la Mezquita Mayor del Albaicín de Época Nazarí: This lookout is often very crowded but has a great view of the Alhambra. You can walk or take a bus to San Nicolas church. There are often people playing Flamenco music and selling paintings and souvenirs. To get away from the crowds, head over to the Mezquita (Mosque) which is right by San Nicolas church. This part is always a lot quieter and still has an amazing view. View of Alhambra from San Nicolas Mirador San Miguel: If you thought San Nicolas was an uphill walk, brace yourself for San Miguel. But no worries, there is also a bus that can take you up. This point gives you another great view of the Alhambra. Many people go to watch the sunrise or sunset from this point. Mirador del Barranco del Abogado: This is my favorite hidden gem. This lookout is unknown to many people. It does not give you a view of the Alhambra, but you have a spectacular view of the city. It is also a steep hike up, but you can find a bus that will bring you pretty close. Relaxing Scenery While in Granada, take advantage of its various parks to relax and have a picnic!\nCarmen de los Martires Garden near the Alhambra. It is quite the hike up the hill, but there is also a bus that takes you right outside the garden. Inside the garden, there are beautiful fountains, plants, bridges, and even some wildlife! There are a few peacocks that live here! Not to mention that this garden has another great view of the city. So, from sunrise to sunset, head to Carmen de los Martires to take some incredible pictures in this peaceful sanctuary. Peacocks in Carmen de los Martires Parque Tico Medina Park right outside of Granada’s science museum, Parque de las Ciencias. (TIP: Parque de las Ciencias is a great, interactive museum for children and adults.) It is a great place to have a picnic when the weather is nice outside! Parque Federico García Lorca A beautiful park with my flowers, trees, and open spaces. There are even two snack bars within the park. Tapa Hop Instead of a bar hop, take your very own tapa hop in Granada. Granada is filled with tapa bars and is one of the only cities in Spain where every drink comes with a free tapa!\nTIP: Some tapas places have a menu to select the tapa you want, while others are random tapas. Make sure to tell the waiter if you have any dietary restrictions.\nTapa Bars El Oju: Vegan Tapas! Bar La Riviera: Very cool vibe, many kinds of tapas La Gioconda: Best to go when the weather is nice, and you can sit outside RompeCabezas El Peruano: Peruvian tapas bar Grifos y Tapas Tired of Tapas? No, tapas are not the only thing Granada has to offer. There are also many great restaurants to enjoy a bigger lunch or dinner.\nMilonga: Argentinian food Divino: Italian cuisine Nickel Burger: Burgers Wild Food: Vegan restaurant Cafes and Ice Cream Be sure to enjoy the abundance of cafes and heladerías around the city! Even try a famous Spanish churro!\nPastelería El Sol: For coffee, tea, and pastries Los Italianos: The best ice cream in town (only open in the summer) Heladería Mamma Alice: Popular ice cream place by the river El Buen Churro: Delicious churros Tourist Attractions Granada is one of the most visited cities in Spain. It’s known for its plazas, fountains, cathedrals, and especially for the Alhambra.\nCathedrals Catedral de Granada Capilla Real de Granada Iglesia Parroquial del Sagrario The Alhambra Be sure to get Alhambra tickets well in advance. I recommend going during the day rather than at night. The best view of the Alhambra at night is from a mirador. To get to the Alhambra, you can walk (very steep) or take the bus. If you take the bus, be sure to walk down for the beautiful scenery.\nFor your first visit, I recommend buying the Alhambra General (full visit) ticket.\nAdult tickets: 19,09 euros Youth (12-15): 12,73 euros Child (3-11): Free Youth and senior citizens of the European Union are offered discounts TIP: Be sure to bring your ticket and passport to the Alhambra! They will scan your passport several times during your journey.\nTIP: While it is pricy, it is worth it. You cannot go to Granada without seeing the Alhambra.\nWith the full visit, you have access to everything. Your entry time on your ticket is for the Palacios Nazaries section. This means that you can arrive whenever you want, but you need to be at the Palacios Nazaries section at your specific time. The rest of the castle is open for you to visit at your pace.\nInside the Alhambra You will need at least a few hours inside the Alhambra. I recommend scheduling a whole day in your itinerary so that you can take your time. The Alhambra is huge! Be sure to also check out the towers. There are many steps, but it is worth it! There is a gorgeous view from the top.\nCultural Experiences Flamenco Dancing: Andalucía is the best place to see Flamenco dancing in Spain. Buy a ticket and enjoy the show! Arab Market: Granada has many Arab influences marked throughout the city. La Alcaicería is recreation of the old Moorish market that existed here before. It is a narrow street filled with small shops. Here you can find some souvenirs that represent Granada. Sacromonte: Walk through the Sacromonte quarter of Granada. It is a gipsy quarter located in the hills of Granada. There you can see typical cave homes. In addition, it is likely to find many flamenco shows in this area in the evening. Looking for more? If you have more time in Granada, take a small day trip to the mountains or the sea. Granada center is located about 1 hour from the Sierra Nevada mountains and 1 hour from the sea. You can take a bus to both and spend the day enjoying the scenery.\n","permalink":"https://blogbirdeyeview.github.io/posts/spain/granada/","summary":"Granada, Spain Travel date January 2023 Check other cities in Spain Exploring Andalucía Did you know Granada means Pomegranate in English?

Well, be sure to consider Tromso, Norway. I can not say enough incredible things about this small Scandinavian town. It is like driving around in a postcard. Every where you look, you are in nature’s paradise. Welcome to Tromso, Norway.\nChasing the Northern Lights Timing is Key In Tromso, the time of the year you travel is key. From the end of May until the end of July, Tromso has a Midnight Sun, which means that the sun never sets! On the other hand, from November to January comes the Polar Night and the sun never rises! Depending on your preferences, plan your trip wisely.\nMy trip was during the Polar Night Season.\nTIP: In the Polar Night season, the sun never appears, but from 9 am until about 1 pm, there is what seems like a sunrise, without the sun. There is a bit of light that peaks through. I recommend driving through the fjords during these hours to get incredible views and pictures.\nTraveling through Tromso While there are a few buses that pass through Tromso, it is most convenient to rent a car. It is fairly easy to drive in the city and most Airbnbs come with free parking. A car always you the opportunity to explore all the nature you want, whenever you want.\nTIP: Do not be afraid to drive in the snowy season. The cars are well made to handle the icy roads and snowy conditions.\nMake your way to the City Center Tromso city center is quite small, but very cute. It sits right along the water. There is a main street to walk through with many restaurants and shops. Be sure to buy a hotdog at the hotdog stand in the center. They are cheap and delicious! (Vegetarian hotdogs available)\nFood Tips Tromso city center is where you are going to find most of the restaurants in the region. CAUTION: Food and alcohol are very expensive in Tromso. We rarely ate at restaurants because of the high prices. I recommend going to the nearest grocery store and picking up some easy meals to cook in your Airbnb. (Even the grocery store has higher prices than normal.)\nA little outside the city center, you can find a cute café that overlooks a fjord. It is called Bryggejentene AS. Sip some coffee, have a pastry, and take in the amazing views.\nTIP: In Norwegian grocery stores, there are many limits on the alcohol they can sell. They only sell beer and ciders. Wines and liquors have to be bought at a liquor store.\nWhat to See There is not too much to visit in the city center. There are a few museums and churches, but the best of Tromso is in the nature.\nTromso Harbour Artic Cathedral The Polar Museum Fjellheisen We did not get a chance to go up this mountain, but the ratings are high. There is a cable car that takes you up to the mountain. Also, you can hike which takes about 45 minutes. From there, you can see views of Tromso and the fjords.\nTromso Harbour Fjords, Fjords, and more Fjords When traveling to Tromso, you really can’t miss the Fjords: They are everywhere! Depending on how many kilometers you have in your rental car, there are many places you can drive to to see incredible views. There are a few that I recommend, all within a 30–35-minute drive from the city center.\nGrotfjorden Tromvik (Viewpoint Waterfalls) Ersfjordbotn There are many parking stops along the roads to stop and take pictures. The listed sites are small villages that are created along the fjord. You can stop before the village and take more pictures along the way.\nTIP: Be careful not to park your car in the passing zone on the road. The roads are small, and sometimes that zone is necessary for cars to pass through.\nTIP: Hiking is also very popular, but not in the winter. The temperatures are extremely cold during the winter months and hiking is more difficult and dangerous. I recommend traveling in the spring or summer for the best hiking weather.\nFjord in Tromso Did someone say Northern Lights? The Northern Lights can be seen in Tromso from September until April. If you rent a car, I do not recommend taking a tour. It is much more convenient and comfortable searching for the lights on your own. The best time to see the lights is between 8 pm and 1 am. So, take a snack, your camera, and some warm clothes, and get hunting!\nWhere to look? Up! In order to see the Northern Lights, you must get out of the city center. Drive to one of the fjord locations listed above. But, do not enter the village because of the light. Stay outside the village and find a good place to park the car. Much of this night will be waiting. The Northern Lights are not something you can see all the time. They come and go. When they come, they may be visible for minutes or hours.\nClimate Conditions Matter Pay attention to the climate conditions before booking your trip. We traveled during a full moon, which really lighted up the sky, impeding our ability to see the Northern Lights clearly. The night must be clear and dark to see the dancing lights. I recommend staying in Tromso for at least 4-6 days in order to ensure your ability to see the Northern Lights at least once during your stay.\n","permalink":"https://blogbirdeyeview.github.io/posts/norway/tromso/","summary":"Tromso, Norway Travel date December 2022 Check other cities in Norway The Most Magical Place on Earth Ever thought about vacationing to one of the most northern points of the world?

Look no more. Take a short 2 hour train ride from Paris to Strasbourg! You can spend 2-3 days in Strasbourg. This small town has everything you need to take the weekend to relax and enjoy the scenery.\nStrolling through Strasbourg Unlike Paris, there are very few tourist attractions to see in Strasbourg. But, after Paris I needed a vacation from my vacation, so Strasbourg was perfect! Strasbourg is a very small town, and it is very manageable to walk everywhere you want to go. There are, however, 6 different tram lines that connect through the city. Strasbourg is on the border of France and Germany, so the town has a big German vibe.\nBEWARE: There are a lot less people who speak English in this town. But, the people seem to be kinder and more patient than in Paris\nHere are a few recommendations while strolling through Strasbourg:\nPetite-France: This is a really cute area of the town. It is a great photo-op right next to the river with beautiful buildings. You can take a walk alongside the river and admire the peacefulness of the town. There are many bridges that cross the river. Some famous bridges are Ponts Couverts and Barrage Vauban. Cathedral of Strasbourg Palace Rohan As I mentioned, there is not much to see as a tourist in Strasbourg. But, it is beautiful to take a walk through the town and explore the different streets.\nStrasbourg Walking over to Germany Why not kill two birds with one stone and touch another country on this trip? Germany is just about 5 km away from the center of Strasbourg. You can walk (which takes about 1 hour) or take the D tram from Strasbourg.\nGetting over the Border I recommend taking the D tram over the border to Germany. You can buy a ticket at the machine at the tram stop. Before getting go the tram, scan your ticket at the machine. Take the tram in the direction of Kehl Rathaus. You can get off at any of the last 2 stops. After getting off, use google maps to walk in the direction of the town near the river!\nDon’t worry, you do not need a passport! Germany and France are both in the European Union, so there is no border control between the two countries. Then, when you are ready to come back, I recommend crossing the Passerelle des Deux Rives bridge back into France. That way, you can say that you walked to another country!\nFrance to the left, Germany to the right What to do in Germany You will enter into a town called Kehl, Germany. Honestly, there is not much to do in this town. It is not a tourist town. I recommend going to the grocery store and buying some German sweets. My favorite German chocolate is Ritter Sport. Also, buy a pretzel and coffee at a bakery! Other than that, you can walk around the town and relax the park right near the bridge.\nWARNING: When I went to Germany, the river between France and Germany had a very bad smell. I am not sure if this was a temporary problem or if it is normal. Don’t say I didn’t warn you!\nHungry for more? Here are some restaurants recommended by me and a friend who frequently travels to Strasbourg:\nOro Restaurant boutique: Latin American food. Very reasonably priced.\nTIP: Make sure to try the arepas! Tzatzi: Italian East Canteen Grand’Rue: Asian fusion Le Cyrano: (outside of the city center, near the train station) : has a little bit of everything and a cheap happy hour ","permalink":"https://blogbirdeyeview.github.io/posts/france/strasbourg/","summary":"Strasbourg, France Travel date January 2023 Check other cities in France Weekend in Strasbourg Looking for a short, quiet get away after your jam-packed trip to Paris?

The city of love. The fashion capital of the world. The home of delicious pastries, the Eiffel Tower, and tons of museums. For this trip, you need about 4-6 days. Pack your bags and Bon Vonyage!\nBest Views in Paris The best views of the city come from 2 places:\nLafayette Partners: This is a huge department store. Skip the shopping and go straight to the terrace! Spend some time taking in the view and taking some amazing pictures. The nice thing about Paris is that the buildings are not so high, so you can see the whole city! Within the department store there is also a cool stain glassed dome in the center to look up at. Basílica del Sacre Coeur: This is a cathedral in which you can go inside for free. I didn’t go inside the church because the view from that point is incredible. You can take the funicular up using a metro ticket (you’ll need another metro ticket if you want to take it down). You can also walk up the stairs. Make sure to walk around and take in the views when you get up there. There is a small garden and cute streets. Be aware of pickpockets! Bird\u0026rsquo;s Eye View from Eiffel Tower Bon Appétit! TIP: Try a sandwich from a sandwich shop! The menus usually come with a sandwich, drink, and a dessert for about 10-12 euros! Great deal and delicious!\nL’Annexe (outside Sainte-Chapelle) (cafe) La Cour de Rome (near Lafayette Partners) (cafe) Fresh Burritos saint - Lazare (near Lafayette Partners and Saint – Lazare metro station) (tacos) TIP: Be sure to eat lots of pastries! Especially Macarons and Merveilleuxs\nTIP: Do not pay more than 2 euros for a macaron! It’s not worth it. A cheaper macaron is just as delicious!\nMoving around Paris Public transportation is not as difficult as it looks. Try it out! Use google maps! The city is well connected by metro and bus. I never took a taxi or tour bus.\nIn the metro stations, there should be a machine to purchase tickets. Each ticket (ticket t+) is 2.10 euros. If you buy a bono of 10 ticket, it is 19.10 euros. The tickets can be used ONLY IN PARIS, in the bus, metro, RER, and T.\nTIP: These tickets cannot be used to go to the airports or to Versailles. You need a special ticket for these destinations. See more information on getting to Versailles.\nThe tickets are small and easy to lose. Don’t lose them! You are supposed to have 1 hour and 30 minutes to use the same tickets for a connection.\nBE ADVISED: Often, the machines where you pass through do not work. Also, you will often see people jumping over the rail for that reason.\nThe Eiffel Tower It is best to buy tickets in advance. You can also get them there, but you’ll have to wait in a longer line. You can enter through entrance 1 or entrance 2, there is no difference. Also, I think it’s best to get there first thing in the morning. There are less people, and you have more time after to explore the city!\nYou have 2 options. You can go to the 2nd floor (which also includes the 1st floor) or you can go to the top floor (which includes the 2nd and 1st floor)\n2nd floor access:\nAdults (25+): 18.10 euros (with elevator) Youth: (12-24) : 9 euros (with elevator) TIP: Take the elevator, there are a ton of stairs. You can always take the stairs down.\nTIP: You get a great view from the 2nd floor. I don’t think the top floor is worth it. Also, the top floor is often closed for events and weather conditions.\nTIP: It is really windy and cold when you go up. Come prepared. (Especially in the winter)\nThere are restaurants and cafes on the second and first floors. It is pretty expensive and not very good. But, the view is nice from the restaurant on the first floor. You can spend as much time as you want inside the tower.\nA nice place to see and take pictures of the Eiffel Tower is right across the street from it. It is called Place du Trocadero. It has the best view of the Eiffel Tower. It is great to visit at night when the tower is lit up. Every hour in the evening the Eiffel Tower has special lights that sparkle. This lasts for 5 minutes.\nView of Eiffel Tower from Place du Trucadero Palace of Versailles To escape from the chaos of Paris, spend a day in the city of Versailles, just a little outside of Paris.\nGetting to Versailles Take the C train in direction to Versailles-Chateau Rive Gauche. Take the train until the end of the line.\nIMPORTANT: DO NOT get on the train without a special ticket. You need a special ticket to go to Versailles from Paris. This ticket costs about 7 euros round trip. You CANNOT use the normal Paris ticket. You can buy these in the machine or ask at the ticket counter. I repeat- DO NOT leave Paris without a special Versailles ticket.\nThe palace TIP: Get tickets in advance. They are 19.50 euros. Guests 18 years and under get in free. (Also any European resident 25 years and under can enter for free). I don’t recommend the audio guide unless you want to know EVERYTHING.\nVersailles is a big palace with many paintings, sculptures, and art inside. The most famous part to see is the Hall of Mirrors. I also recommend the gardens. In the winter, it’s not so beautiful. But I’m sure in the summer and spring it would be gorgeous. The gardens are free for everyone to walk through.\n","permalink":"https://blogbirdeyeview.github.io/posts/france/paris/","summary":"Paris, France Travel date January 2023 Check other cities in France Exploring Paris Welcome to Paris!

Start practicing your British accent and touch up on your British English dialect. Pro tip: Chips are French Fries and the lift is the elevator! I recommend at least 5 days in the city. London is a city that you can visit many times and always see something new.\nThe Underground, AKA: The Subway No need to fear! London is connected through undergrounds and busses! No need for a taxi, ever!\nLike most cities, if you want to take the train from the airport to the city, you will need a special ticket. You can buy that at the machines within the station. You may have to take a connection, but don’t worry, you can do it! Use google map: It becomes your best friend. If you mess up and go the wrong direction, just get off at the next stop and turn around and go the other direction!\nTIP: London undergrounds are REALLY underground and you will most likely not get any phone service below. So, make sure you know where you are going before you go under the ground.\nYou can pay the underground using your credit card (but it has to be a tap card) or Apple/google pay. This is the easiest and cheapest way to travel. Each traveler needs their own credit card, you cannot share. You will have to tap your card before and after getting on and off the underground. You don’t need to buy a ticket when inside of London (only for the airport). The cost of the trip will depend on how far you go and how many zones you travel through.\nTIP: Undergrounds run less frequently on the weekends, so plan ahead.\nTIP: Don’t be afraid of connections! It is very common to take a connection, and you most likely won’t have to leave the underground.\nLondon Attractions (An Outsider\u0026rsquo;s Persepctive) Of course, you can always pay to enter every building, but you are looking at making a dent in your bank account. So, why not take pictures from the outside? It’s free and beautiful! Here are some of my recommendations of what to see from an outsider’s perspective.\nChurches St. Paul’s Cathedral\nWestminster’s Abbey\nMonuments Big Ben\nParliament\nLondon Eye\nBuckingham Palace: You can see the changing of the guards throughout the day on the hour. The big event happens Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday at 11 am. I did not go to this event because I heard it was super crowded. Even watching the simple change was interesting!\nWestminster Bridge: I recommend crossing the bridge and walking along the river towards The London Eye. There are food trucks and street artists along the way. Then you can walk over the Hungerford Bridge which is only for pedestrians.\nLondon Eye Parks St. James Park: Very peaceful park to walk through. There are many ducks, swans, and pigeons. Also, people often bring a bag of peanuts to feed the squirrels. Hyde Park: When you go to see Kensington Palace, you will be forced to walk through Hyde Park. You can spend hours in Hyde Park. Maybe even a picnic! Streets to Stoll Down Piccadilly Circus: Fun fact: it’s not actually a circus! It’s the “Times Square” of London! Many restaurants, stores, and people! Fun to walk down and people watch. Abbey Road Crossing ⁃ This is far from of all the tourist attractions, in zone 2 of London (recommendation: If you go to Madame Tussaud’s Museum, it is not too far from there)\n⁃ There is not much here! Just the famous street from the Beetles album cover. That’s it!\n⁃ Be careful! This street is not blocked off from traffic. Therefore, there are many cars that pass through and many dumb tourists who try to take a picture (my dad included). Very chaotic situation!\n⁃ There is a small store close to the studio. You cannot go inside the studio but you can take a picture from the outside.\n⁃ There are no other stores or restaurants near by, so get back on the underground!\nLondon Attractions (An Insider\u0026rsquo;s Persepctive) When traveling to London, I recommend paying for at least 2-3 attractions to go inside. Here are a few that I checked out from an insider\u0026rsquo;s perspective.\nTower of London I recommend buying tickets in advance BUT you will most likely still have to wait in line for at least 30 minutes. So, get there early before your ticket time. They don’t put you in line with accordance to your ticket time.\nAdult: 29.90 pounds Student: 24 pounds\nYou will most likely spend 1-2 hours inside. You can learn about the fortress and some English history. Also, there are many interactive activities for children inside.\nLondon Tower Tower Bridge I recommend going up at least once in your life. You can take the stairs (caution there are a lot) or the elevator.\nTickets: Adults (16-59): 11.40 pounds Child (5-15): 5.70 pounds Student: 8.60 pounds Senior: (60+): 8.60 pounds\nKensington Palace I am not 100% convinced it was worth it to go inside. You can learn about the history of 3 royal kings and queens from the UK. It was a quick visit (30-40 minutes). The gardens are nice to walk around (those are free!) There is a Princess Diana memorial in the garden. And of course, take pictures of the palace from the outside.\nTickets: Adult: 16 pounds Student: 12.80 pounds Child: 8 pounds\nMadame Tussaud\u0026rsquo;s London The wax museum! There are wax figures of many famous people, including actors, singers, political figures, Marvel characters, etc. Very fun for all ages. Unfortunately, when we went it was way overcrowded. Try to go during an off season for tourism. You can buy tickets in advance or get them at the door. I recommend the standard ticket. There is so much to see, without the extra add ons.\nTickets: Adults: 37 pounds Child: 33.50 pounds\nFueling your Body Harrison’s coffee (near Kensington Palace) (Chilean restaurant)\nBar and Block Steakhouse Aldgate (near the London Tower) (steak and fish)\nThe Ivy City Garden (near the London Tower) (fish and seafood and burgers)\nTIP: Pubs are a great vibe for drinking, but the food quality and staff service are not great. Drink a few pints at the pub and have dinner at another restaurant\n","permalink":"https://blogbirdeyeview.github.io/posts/uk/london/","summary":"London, England Travel date December 2022 Check other cities in United Kingdom London Here We Come Welcome to London!
