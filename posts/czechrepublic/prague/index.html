This beautiful city will leave you impressed as you explore its marvelous architecture and unique history. Get lost walking through the streets to experience what this cute city has to offer.\nPrague is a rather small city; therefore, you only need about 2 to 3 days to see the top attractions. Everything is relatively walkable, but the transportation system will also be helpful. There is an app called “pid” that will allow you to buy all of your tickets. I recommend buying the 24 hour pass if you plan on using the transport more than 2 times a day. It is very cheap and super convenient to navigate around the city.\nOld Town First on your list, old town Prague. Head to the Old Town Square and take in the beauty. Stop by the Astrological Clock Tower on the hour to see a little entertainment show from the tower.\nAstrological Clock Tower In the square, make sure to buy a BIG potato pancake and a hot wine (when weather permits). The potato pancake is the size of your face and is absolutely delicious.\nAfter that, stroll through the streets and explore the shops and restaurants.\nTIP: There are many tourists in Prague! So many! Since the city is not so big, the tourists are concentrated in the most touristy attractions. Be aware of theft and added stress for this reason.\nJewish Quarter Be sure to walk through the Jewish Quarter of the city. Here you can find a Jewish museum, a synagogue, and a Jewish cemetery.\nOther Must Sees National Memorial to the Heroes of the Heyrich Terror If you are interested in WWII history, I definitely recommend the museum of National Memorial to the Heroes of the Heydrich Terror. This free museum (which is below a church) tells the story of the group of Czech soldiers who aided in the Czech resistance against Nazi Germany during WWII and memorializes the men who hid and were killed in the crypt below this church. This is a story that many have not learned in the history books and stands out for its bravery and heroism.\nCharles Bridge Sure, you should check out this bridge and cross it off your bucket list. If you are into statues, the bridge is full of them! Most of them are Catholic religious figures. Being one of the most famous attractions of Prague, the bridge is bound to be super crowded, but there is plenty of space to take your pictures with the beautiful river background.\nJohn Lennon Wall It is worth mentioning the John Lennon Wall, which once was a symbol of peace, freedom, and democracy. Now, the wall has lost some of its meaning, but still serves as a expression of voice to artists around the world.\nJohn Lennon Wall A Bird’s Eye View If you really want to see Prague from a bird’s eye view, be sure to check out Petrin Hill and Letna Park. Enjoy the beautiful nature, activities, and views over the city.\nPetrin Hill To go up to Petrin Hill you can take the funicular up. For tickets you can use your 24 hour transport pass, or buy a separate transportation ticket for the funicular. If you are feeling adventurous and energetic you can even walk to the top!\nFunicular to Petrin Hill Petrin Hill is a big park on the top of a hill filled with trees, plants, flowers, and fresh air. It is the perfect escape from the crowded city center.\nThe most visited attraction on Petrin Hill is the Petrin Tower, which is a big tower that resembles the Eiffel Tower. Tickets are 290 Kc for adults and 195 Kc for students, seniors, and children. Personally, I think the tower is pretty ugly, and not worth the money (or the steps).\nInstead, I recommend enjoying a beverage at the cafe that overlooks the city. You can get to this cafe by getting off at the first stop on the funicular (There are 2 stops total). There are about 10 small tables which overlook the city, allowing you to sit and sip a coffee, hot chocolate, wine, or beer with a beautiful bird’s eye view over Prague.\nLetna Park In the mood for some more nature? Take a tram up to Letna Park. It is a huge park where people go to walk, exercise, and drink! There is a beer garden where you can sit and enjoy the incredible view of the city.\nA bird’s eye view of Prague Prague Castle The final bird’s eye view is from the famous Prague Castle. I recommend paying the Basic Circuit to see some of the gems of the castle including, Old Royal Palace, St. George’s Basilica, Golden Lane, and St. Vitus Cathedral. Adults pay a fee of 250 Kc and students and children only 125 Kc.\nYou can spend at least a couple of hours exploring the castle grounds. There is a lot to see and beautiful views from above.\nInside St. Vitus Cathedral Must Haves I have 2 must have restaurants that you should not pass up!\nKnedlín: Enjoy a traditional Czech dumpling! There are over 10 flavors to choose from, each better than the next. Choose from your choice of savory or sweet! Knedlíky Alebrijes Cocina Mexicana: I know it sounds strange, Mexican food in Czech Republic? But yes! If you are near Letna Park, this is a perfect place to get lunch! The servers are kind and the food is delicious. The best Mexican restaurant that I’ve tried in all of Europe!
