Welcome to Málaga! The birthplace of Pablo Picasso! Spend about 2 days exploring this fantastic Andalusian city. Enjoy the seafood, paella, and everything else that this city has to offer.\nTravel in Málaga Airport Málaga has an international airport! The airport is located about 20 minutes outside of Málaga center. There is a train (Renfe C1) or bus (Alsa) that can take you to the center from the airport. There are also buses that can take you from Málaga airport to nearby cities like Granada, Sevilla, or Marbella.\nMálaga Airport Metro While Málaga is a walkabout city, it also has 2 metro lines. You can buy a metro card at one of the stations and take the metro to wherever you need to go. (One metro card can be used for multiple passengers)\nBus You can also hop on any bus to get to your destination. You can pay on the bus with cash. Each ticket within the city will cost 1.40 euros.\nTrain To get outside of Málaga center to a nearby city, use trains C1 and C2. These trains have special tickets, which you can buy in the station. Or you can use your credit card to tap at the gate. (Each passenger needs their own ticket or their own credit card).\nCity Center Attractions Málaga is home to MANY museums. You can find art museums, history museums, wine museums, and soccer museums.\nRoman Theatre: Marvel at the ruins of this ancient Roman monument. It is believed to be one of Europe’s oldest theaters, dating back to the first century.\nMálaga’s Cathedral: Yes, like most Spanish cities, Málaga has a huge cathedral! It’s located in the heart of the city center, you can’t miss it!\nMálaga Cathedral Pablo Picasso Museum: See Picasso’s art work in his hometown! Tickets are 9.50 euros and 7.50 euros for students under 26 years old and adults over 65 years old. Free entry for children under 17 years old and people with disabilities. Shop til you drop Málaga center is filled with stores. Some of my favorites include Mango, Springfield, and Zara.\nSeaside Activities Málaga is a port city, so be sure to bring your bathing suit and sunscreen and head to the beach!\nBecause Málaga is a port city, the beaches in the center are not the best for swimming. But, close by you can find a large selection of beaches to test out.\nTake a stroll along the pier. Along the pier you will find various restaurants, ice cream shops, and stores. Enjoy the beautiful views and opportunities to soak in the Mediterranean sun.\nParque de Málaga: Near the pier is a beautiful park to walk through. Enjoy the flowers, fountains, and monuments.\nUp, Up, and Away If you are looking for more of an active day, you can hike up to a lookout (or take a taxi). The lookouts are called Mirador de Gibralfaro and Mirador de la Coracha. The hike from the center takes about 30 minutes. You can take the stairs which are more direct or get there by a gradual ascend which takes longer but is easier on the body. I recommend the gradual ascend, you can take stops along the way and most of it is in the shade. Then you can take the stairs down. The gradual incline path starts next to the Roman Theatre. If you choose the stairs, they start near Parque de Málaga.\nMálaga from Mirador de Gibralfaro While up on the hill, take a tour of the Gibraltaro Castle and Alcazaba. The alcazaba was a palace home to Muslim rulers in the 11th century. The Gibraltaro Castle was built in the 14th century to protect the Alcazaba. Tickets to visit both the castle and Alcazaba are 5.50 euros. If you choose just to visit one of the monuments, it is 3.50 euros.\nDay trips outside Málaga Torremolinos: If you are looking for a beach day, take the C1 train to Torremolinos, a nearby city in the region of Málaga. Here you can find plenty of beaches, fantastic restaurants, and a cute center to stroll through. This is one of my favorite cities because it is a little less hectic than Málaga and has wonderful beaches to relax. TIP: If you have an early flight out of Málaga, I recommend staying in Torremolinos the night before. It is close to the airport and you can take a day to relax by the beach before your long journey.\nRonda: Take a 2 hour bus to Ronda, a city between Málaga and Sevilla. This is one of my favorite cities in Spain. It is super small, so you only need a day or two. This town has an old, historical vibe and offers great photo opportunities. Take a walk through the streets and take in the scenic views.\nMarbella: Marbella is about 1 hour from Málaga. Marbella is the oo-la-la city of Andalucía. Here you will find luxury stores, bars, clubs, and yachts. If you are looking to party like a king, Marbella is your place to be.\nCaminito del Rey: About 1 hour away from Málaga. A fantastic hiking path with spectacular views. This path is more than 100 meters above the ground. The path is one way, so there is no turning back. You need to book a ticket in advance. Tickets are 10 euros for general entry and 18 euros if you want a guide. Tickets sell out fast, so make sure to book far in advance. The hike takes between 2 and 3 hours.\n","wordCount":"937","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://blogbirdeyeview.github.io/img/02spain/01malaga/01mirador.jpg","datePublished":"2023-05-07T10:30:30+01:00","dateModified":"2023-05-07T10:30:30+01:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Nicole"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://blogbirdeyeview.github.io/posts/spain/malaga/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Bird’s
