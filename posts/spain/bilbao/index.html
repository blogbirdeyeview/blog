Here you will find people speaking Spanish AND Basque (Euskera). The Basque language is very different from Spanish and any other language. But, no worries. Everyone in the city center will also speak Spanish and some even English. So… pack your bags and welcome to Bilbao.\nArrival Welcome to Bilbao Bilbao is in the north of Spain, about 400 kilometers from Madrid. You can fly into Bilbao’s airport (with a connection) or take a bus or train from Madrid. From the airport, take bus A3247 to the city center for only 3 euros. It is quick and leaves every 15 minutes.\nTIP: If you have a late check-in to your hotel or Airbnb, you can store your luggage in a locker at the Bilbao bus station (Bilbao Intermodal). The airport bus will take you to the bus station at its last stop. The lockers cost about 5 euros for 1 day. It is a large locker that can fit several backpacks or a large suitcase. There is a machine that will assign you a locker and you must pay with a credit card. (EXTRA TIP: Take a picture of the code that the machine gives you. You will need that code to open up your locker.)\nTIP: On your way back to the airport, be sure to use your Barik card to pay on the bus. It will cost you only 50 cents instead of the 3 euros. It is almost impossible to do this on the way there because there are no machines in the airport to buy a Barik card. But, if you are a returning visitor to Bilbao, be sure to use your Barik card for your roundtrip.\nPhoto Opportunities San Mames Stadium: Any soccer fans out there? Stop by San Mames Stadium to take a picture in front of Bilbao’s home stadium. There are also shops and a museum to really soak in the sport’s atmosphere.\nErrukiaren Parkea: Beautiful park close to the San Mames Stadium. Relax in the shade and listen to the calming sounds of the fountain.\nDoña Casilda de Iturrizar Park: The first thing I noticed about Bilbao was all the green in the city. So many trees, grass, and flowers. Walk through this amazing park to admire the various fountains, sculptures, flowers, and ponds. TIP: Buy some ready-made food from a nearby supermarket (for example, Mercadona) and take it to this park to have a small picnic. There is plenty of shade and space to relax.\nDoña Casilda de Iturrizar Park Plaza de Don Federico Moyúa: This huge roundabout is actually a plaza! Walk around and take pictures with the gorgeous flowers and big fountain. Beware, this plaza does not have much shade, so the sun can be very powerful. Spring Flowers at the Plaza Mirador de Artxanda: Lookout over all of Bilbao. Take the funicular to this incredible view. The funicular station is located at the bottom and is called “Estación del Funicular de Artxanda”. You can use your Barik transport card and the ticket will be about 30 cents. The funicular comes every 15 minutes. Once you are up there, you can relax, take pictures, and walk around. Then come back down whenever you are ready. (You have to pay a return ticket as well) TIP: There is also a hiking trail if you wish to hike there. It takes about 45 minutes to an hour. But, beware, it is very high up! Getting Around Bilbao is a very hilly city. There are many ups and downs. While you can walk wherever you need to go, there are also options of transportation that you should take advantage of.\nMetro: There are 3 metro lines: L1, L2, L3\nBus: Many buses that will get you to where you need to go.\nFunicular: There are 3 funiculars to reach the top of big hills\nEuskotren: 3 trains that go a little bit outside of the city center.\nTranvía: 1 train that runs through the city center.\nTren Renfe: 5 trains that pass through different zones. This train will be more expensive than the rest.\nWhile it can be confusing on which transportation to take, rely on your google maps. Put in your destination and google will tell you which transportation to take.\nTIP: I recommend getting the Barik transport card. This can be bought in the metro stations or a Tobacco store. The card costs 3 euros and needs a minimum of 5 euros credit, so 8 euros total. This card can be used on any Bilbao transportation. The same one card can also be used by several people in your group (up to 10 people).\nBeach Day While Bilbao is generally a little colder than the rest of Spain, there are still plenty of opportunities to spend a day at the beach on a sunny day.\nI recommend getting on the metro and heading to the beach. There are several beaches to choose from, however, since Bilbao is a port city, some beaches may not be so beautiful. I recommend heading a little outside of Bilbao to Plentzia Beach. You can get there by taking the Plentzia metro line all the way to the end of the line. The total trip will take about an hour. You can use your Barik transport card and the whole trip will cost you less than a euro. After you get off the metro, you can cross the bridge and walk along the coast for about 15 to 20 minutes to arrive at the beach. The sand at the beach is very clean and not rocky. Warning: There are no umbrellas or chairs to rent. The whole beach is directly in the sun. After taking a dip, walk around the small city center near the beach to get a bite to eat or an ice cream.\nPlentzia Dock The Downtown Take a day to explore the historical center of Bilbao. Walk through the enchanting streets and soak in all the Spanish vibes. Walk along the river and admire the beautiful bridges in the city. Here are some stops to make along the way.\nColorful Houses of Bilbao Mercado de La Ribera: Next to the river you can find Bilbao’s big market. Inside you can eat, drink, and relax. In Bilbao they are famous for their pintxos, which is a piece of bread with basically any combination on top, including seafood, meat, Spanish tortilla, olives, and cheese.\nIglesia San Antón: Next to the market, admire this historical church. Unfortunately, it does not make for a great photo because there are almost always people sitting on the steps, smoking cigarettes and drinking beer. But, it is still a pretty church to see.\nCatedral De Santiago de Bilbao: From afar, you will be able to look up and see a big cross coming out of this tall cathedral. However, when you get up close, it is a little harder to see. The cathedral is surrounded by buildings and restaurants. But, you can go inside for 6 euros to see this 14th century cathedral.\nPlaza Nueva: Almost every big city in Spain has a plaza nueva, and this one is no different. It is a big plaza surrounded by restaurants and shops. Stop by to see a traditional Spanish plaza.\nNervión River: Walk along Bilbao’s river until you get to Guggenheim’s Museum. The river is beautiful and the bridges are impressive.\nNervión River Guggenheim’s Museum: Even if you are not a museum person, be sure to walk around this one. The architecture of the building is incredible and iconic. Be sure to see the sculptures of the flowered dog behind the building and the enormous spider in front. The museum is an art museum. Tickets are 16 euros for adults, free for children up to 17 years old, 8 euros for students 18 to 26 years old, and 8 euros for adults over 65 years old. Flowered Dog Day Trip Have an extra day to spare? Take a day trip to Santander, a small city about 1 ½ hours from Bilbao.\nTake a short bus ride (Alsa bus) from Bilbao to Santander. You can leave in the morning and come back in the evening. The bus ride costs about 15 euros round trip.\nOnce you get to Santander, walk around the city center (which is near the bus station). It is a small city center, but there are a few stops you should make.\nSantander’s Cathedral\nParque de las Cachavas\nPaseo Marítimo de Santander (Seaside walking area) TIP: If you are looking for an ice cream break, be sure to stop at Via Mazzini. Delicious ice cream for a reasonable price.\nAfter seeing the center, head on over to the seafront. It is a pretty long walk, but if you make some stops along the way, it should be no problem.\nBe sure to walk through Túnel de Tetúan. It is an old tunnel that recently opened for pedestrians. It is on the way to the beach and is super cool to walk through.\nEl Sardinero: Beautiful beach! The water is so clear and the sand is very clean.\nSardinero Beach Jardines de Piquio: Near the beach there is a small garden that overlooks the sea. It is gorgeous and a nice place to relax and listen to the waves.

Stop by to see a traditional Spanish plaza.</p></li><li><p>Nervión River: Walk along Bilbao&rsquo;s river until you get to Guggenheim&rsquo;s Museum.

Take a day trip to Santander, a small city about 1 ½ hours from Bilbao.</p><p>Take a short bus ride (Alsa bus) from Bilbao to Santander. You can leave in the morning and come back in the evening. The bus ride costs about 15 euros round trip.</p><p>Once you get to Santander, walk around the city center (which is near the bus station). It is a small city center, but there are a few stops you should make.</p><ul><li><p>Santander’s Cathedral</p></li><li><p>Parque de las Cachavas</p></li><li><p>Paseo Marítimo de Santander (Seaside walking area)
TIP: If you are looking for an ice cream break, be sure to stop at Via Mazzini. Delicious ice cream for a reasonable price.</p></li></ul><p>After seeing the center, head on over to the seafront. It is a pretty long walk, but if you make some stops along the way, it should be no problem.</p><ul><li><p>Be sure to walk through Túnel de Tetúan. It is an old tunnel that recently opened for pedestrians. It is on the way to the beach and is super cool to walk through.</p></li><li><p>El Sardinero: Beautiful beach! The water is so clear and the sand is very clean.</p></li></ul><figure class=prego-figure><img loading=lazy src=08bilbaosantander.jpg alt="Sardinero Beach"><figcaption class=prego-figcaption>Sardinero Beach</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Jardines de Piquio: Near the beach there is a small garden that overlooks the sea.
