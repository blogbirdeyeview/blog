Welcome to Granada! Granada is located in the southern part of Spain, called Andalucía. Here, you will hear people speaking Spanish! In the tourist center, you can find people who speak English in some shops and restaurants. Granada is home to the most visited attraction in Spain, the Alhambra.\nArriving at Granada Granada is a small city in Spain with a population of only about 200,000. There are several ways to arrive to Granada.\nAirplane: Granada has a small “international” airport. While it is international, the only countries you can travel directly to are England and France. But, you can take a connection flight from Madrid or Barcelona. The closest bigger airport is in Malaga, Spain. From Malaga, you can take a train or bus to Granada, which takes about 2 hours. Bus: Granada is connected to many Spanish cities by bus. A popular bus company is called Alsa. Train: Granada has a train station directly in the city center! The company is called Renfe. The train to and from Granada will only take you inside of Spain. If you are coming from outside of Spain, you will need to take a few connections. Deciding on when to travel When planning your trip to the south of Spain, be sure to consider the weather conditions. Granada is extremely hot in the summer months: June, July, and August. Temperatures can reach over 40 degrees Celsius / 104 degrees Fahrenheit on a daily basis.\nThe winter months: December, January, and February have moderate temperatures, the minimum reaching about -5 degrees Celsius / 23 degrees Fahrenheit. In Granada, you almost never see snow in the center, but you will most likely see snow in the Sierra Nevada mountains. Granada is a mostly sunny region, so pack your sunscreen and your sunglasses, even in the winter!\nLos Miradores (Lookouts) The best part about Granada is all of its incredible views. Granada is a hilly city, so bring your walking shoes and get ready to put in about 20,000 steps a day!\nTIP: It is easy to get “lost” in the streets of Granada. They were designed that way to run away from invaders! But, most streets are connected, so don’t worry. Use google maps, ask someone you see, and just explore! Roaming through the narrow streets of Granada is the best way to experience the city.\nThe best lookouts Mirador San Nicolas / Patio de la Mezquita Mayor del Albaicín de Época Nazarí: This lookout is often very crowded but has a great view of the Alhambra. You can walk or take a bus to San Nicolas church. There are often people playing Flamenco music and selling paintings and souvenirs. To get away from the crowds, head over to the Mezquita (Mosque) which is right by San Nicolas church. This part is always a lot quieter and still has an amazing view. View of Alhambra from San Nicolas Mirador San Miguel: If you thought San Nicolas was an uphill walk, brace yourself for San Miguel. But no worries, there is also a bus that can take you up. This point gives you another great view of the Alhambra. Many people go to watch the sunrise or sunset from this point. Mirador del Barranco del Abogado: This is my favorite hidden gem. This lookout is unknown to many people. It does not give you a view of the Alhambra, but you have a spectacular view of the city. It is also a steep hike up, but you can find a bus that will bring you pretty close. Relaxing Scenery While in Granada, take advantage of its various parks to relax and have a picnic!\nCarmen de los Martires Garden near the Alhambra. It is quite the hike up the hill, but there is also a bus that takes you right outside the garden. Inside the garden, there are beautiful fountains, plants, bridges, and even some wildlife! There are a few peacocks that live here! Not to mention that this garden has another great view of the city. So, from sunrise to sunset, head to Carmen de los Martires to take some incredible pictures in this peaceful sanctuary. Peacocks in Carmen de los Martires Parque Tico Medina Park right outside of Granada’s science museum, Parque de las Ciencias. (TIP: Parque de las Ciencias is a great, interactive museum for children and adults.) It is a great place to have a picnic when the weather is nice outside! Parque Federico García Lorca A beautiful park with my flowers, trees, and open spaces. There are even two snack bars within the park. Tapa Hop Instead of a bar hop, take your very own tapa hop in Granada. Granada is filled with tapa bars and is one of the only cities in Spain where every drink comes with a free tapa!\nTIP: Some tapas places have a menu to select the tapa you want, while others are random tapas. Make sure to tell the waiter if you have any dietary restrictions.\nTapa Bars El Oju: Vegan Tapas! Bar La Riviera: Very cool vibe, many kinds of tapas La Gioconda: Best to go when the weather is nice, and you can sit outside RompeCabezas El Peruano: Peruvian tapas bar Grifos y Tapas Tired of Tapas? No, tapas are not the only thing Granada has to offer. There are also many great restaurants to enjoy a bigger lunch or dinner.\nMilonga: Argentinian food Divino: Italian cuisine Nickel Burger: Burgers Wild Food: Vegan restaurant Cafes and Ice Cream Be sure to enjoy the abundance of cafes and heladerías around the city! Even try a famous Spanish churro!\nPastelería El Sol: For coffee, tea, and pastries Los Italianos: The best ice cream in town (only open in the summer) Heladería Mamma Alice: Popular ice cream place by the river El Buen Churro: Delicious churros Tourist Attractions Granada is one of the most visited cities in Spain. It’s known for its plazas, fountains, cathedrals, and especially for the Alhambra.\nCathedrals Catedral de Granada Capilla Real de Granada Iglesia Parroquial del Sagrario The Alhambra Be sure to get Alhambra tickets well in advance. I recommend going during the day rather than at night. The best view of the Alhambra at night is from a mirador. To get to the Alhambra, you can walk (very steep) or take the bus. If you take the bus, be sure to walk down for the beautiful scenery.\nFor your first visit, I recommend buying the Alhambra General (full visit) ticket.\nAdult tickets: 19,09 euros Youth (12-15): 12,73 euros Child (3-11): Free Youth and senior citizens of the European Union are offered discounts TIP: Be sure to bring your ticket and passport to the Alhambra! They will scan your passport several times during your journey.\nTIP: While it is pricy, it is worth it. You cannot go to Granada without seeing the Alhambra.\nWith the full visit, you have access to everything. Your entry time on your ticket is for the Palacios Nazaries section. This means that you can arrive whenever you want, but you need to be at the Palacios Nazaries section at your specific time. The rest of the castle is open for you to visit at your pace.\nInside the Alhambra You will need at least a few hours inside the Alhambra. I recommend scheduling a whole day in your itinerary so that you can take your time. The Alhambra is huge! Be sure to also check out the towers. There are many steps, but it is worth it! There is a gorgeous view from the top.\nCultural Experiences Flamenco Dancing: Andalucía is the best place to see Flamenco dancing in Spain. Buy a ticket and enjoy the show! Arab Market: Granada has many Arab influences marked throughout the city. La Alcaicería is recreation of the old Moorish market that existed here before. It is a narrow street filled with small shops. Here you can find some souvenirs that represent Granada. Sacromonte: Walk through the Sacromonte quarter of Granada. It is a gipsy quarter located in the hills of Granada. There you can see typical cave homes. In addition, it is likely to find many flamenco shows in this area in the evening. Looking for more? If you have more time in Granada, take a small day trip to the mountains or the sea. Granada center is located about 1 hour from the Sierra Nevada mountains and 1 hour from the sea. You can take a bus to both and spend the day enjoying the scenery.\n","wordCount":"1439","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://live.staticflickr.com/4378/36551326473_109a5fdd38_b.jpg","datePublished":"2023-01-18T10:30:30+01:00","dateModified":"2023-01-18T10:30:30+01:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Nicole"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://blogbirdeyeview.github.io/posts/spain/granada/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Bird’s

I recommend going during the day rather than at night. The best view of the Alhambra at night is from a mirador. To get to the Alhambra, you can walk (very steep) or take the bus. If you take the bus, be sure to walk down for the beautiful scenery.</p><p>For your first visit, I recommend buying the Alhambra General (full visit) ticket.</p><ul><li>Adult tickets: 19,09 euros</li><li>Youth (12-15): 12,73 euros</li><li>Child (3-11): Free</li><li>Youth and senior citizens of the European Union are offered discounts</li></ul><p><em>TIP: Be sure to bring your ticket and passport to the Alhambra! They will scan your passport several times during your journey.</em></p><p><em>TIP: While it is pricy, it is worth it. You cannot go to Granada without seeing the Alhambra.</em></p><p>With the full visit, you have access to everything. Your entry time on your ticket is for the Palacios Nazaries section. This means that you can arrive whenever you want, but you need to be at the Palacios Nazaries section at your specific time. The rest of the castle is open for you to visit at your pace.</p><figure class=prego-figure><img loading=lazy src=01alhambragranada.jpg alt="Inside the Alhambra"><figcaption class=prego-figcaption>Inside the Alhambra</figcaption></figure><p>You will need at least a few hours inside the Alhambra. I recommend scheduling a whole day in your itinerary so that you can take your time. The Alhambra is huge! Be sure to also check out the towers. There are many steps, but it is worth it! There is a gorgeous view from the top.</p><h2 id=cultural-experiences>Cultural Experiences<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#cultural-experiences>#</a></h2><ul><li>Flamenco Dancing: Andalucía is the best place to see Flamenco dancing in Spain. Buy a ticket and enjoy the show!</li><li>Arab Market: Granada has many Arab influences marked throughout the city. La Alcaicería is recreation of the old Moorish market that existed here before. It is a narrow street filled with small shops. Here you can find some souvenirs that represent Granada.</li><li>Sacromonte: Walk through the Sacromonte quarter of Granada. It is a gipsy quarter located in the hills of Granada. There you can see typical cave homes. In addition, it is likely to find many flamenco shows in this area in the evening.</li></ul><h2 id=looking-for-more>Looking for more?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#looking-for-more>#</a></h2><p>If you have more time in Granada, take a small day trip to the mountains or the sea. Granada center is located about 1 hour from the Sierra Nevada mountains and 1 hour from the sea. You can take a bus to both and spend the day enjoying the scenery.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://blogbirdeyeview.github.io/tags/spain/>Spain</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://blogbirdeyeview.github.io/posts/spain/salamanca/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Salamanca, Spain</span>
