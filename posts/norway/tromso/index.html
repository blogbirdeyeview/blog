Well, be sure to consider Tromso, Norway. I can not say enough incredible things about this small Scandinavian town. It is like driving around in a postcard. Every where you look, you are in nature’s paradise. Welcome to Tromso, Norway.\nChasing the Northern Lights Timing is Key In Tromso, the time of the year you travel is key. From the end of May until the end of July, Tromso has a Midnight Sun, which means that the sun never sets! On the other hand, from November to January comes the Polar Night and the sun never rises! Depending on your preferences, plan your trip wisely.\nMy trip was during the Polar Night Season.\nTIP: In the Polar Night season, the sun never appears, but from 9 am until about 1 pm, there is what seems like a sunrise, without the sun. There is a bit of light that peaks through. I recommend driving through the fjords during these hours to get incredible views and pictures.\nTraveling through Tromso While there are a few buses that pass through Tromso, it is most convenient to rent a car. It is fairly easy to drive in the city and most Airbnbs come with free parking. A car always you the opportunity to explore all the nature you want, whenever you want.\nTIP: Do not be afraid to drive in the snowy season. The cars are well made to handle the icy roads and snowy conditions.\nMake your way to the City Center Tromso city center is quite small, but very cute. It sits right along the water. There is a main street to walk through with many restaurants and shops. Be sure to buy a hotdog at the hotdog stand in the center. They are cheap and delicious! (Vegetarian hotdogs available)\nFood Tips Tromso city center is where you are going to find most of the restaurants in the region. CAUTION: Food and alcohol are very expensive in Tromso. We rarely ate at restaurants because of the high prices. I recommend going to the nearest grocery store and picking up some easy meals to cook in your Airbnb. (Even the grocery store has higher prices than normal.)\nA little outside the city center, you can find a cute café that overlooks a fjord. It is called Bryggejentene AS. Sip some coffee, have a pastry, and take in the amazing views.\nTIP: In Norwegian grocery stores, there are many limits on the alcohol they can sell. They only sell beer and ciders. Wines and liquors have to be bought at a liquor store.\nWhat to See There is not too much to visit in the city center. There are a few museums and churches, but the best of Tromso is in the nature.\nTromso Harbour Artic Cathedral The Polar Museum Fjellheisen We did not get a chance to go up this mountain, but the ratings are high. There is a cable car that takes you up to the mountain. Also, you can hike which takes about 45 minutes. From there, you can see views of Tromso and the fjords.\nTromso Harbour Fjords, Fjords, and more Fjords When traveling to Tromso, you really can’t miss the Fjords: They are everywhere! Depending on how many kilometers you have in your rental car, there are many places you can drive to to see incredible views. There are a few that I recommend, all within a 30–35-minute drive from the city center.\nGrotfjorden Tromvik (Viewpoint Waterfalls) Ersfjordbotn There are many parking stops along the roads to stop and take pictures. The listed sites are small villages that are created along the fjord. You can stop before the village and take more pictures along the way.\nTIP: Be careful not to park your car in the passing zone on the road. The roads are small, and sometimes that zone is necessary for cars to pass through.\nTIP: Hiking is also very popular, but not in the winter. The temperatures are extremely cold during the winter months and hiking is more difficult and dangerous. I recommend traveling in the spring or summer for the best hiking weather.\nFjord in Tromso Did someone say Northern Lights? The Northern Lights can be seen in Tromso from September until April. If you rent a car, I do not recommend taking a tour. It is much more convenient and comfortable searching for the lights on your own. The best time to see the lights is between 8 pm and 1 am. So, take a snack, your camera, and some warm clothes, and get hunting!\nWhere to look? Up! In order to see the Northern Lights, you must get out of the city center. Drive to one of the fjord locations listed above. But, do not enter the village because of the light. Stay outside the village and find a good place to park the car. Much of this night will be waiting. The Northern Lights are not something you can see all the time. They come and go. When they come, they may be visible for minutes or hours.\nClimate Conditions Matter Pay attention to the climate conditions before booking your trip. We traveled during a full moon, which really lighted up the sky, impeding our ability to see the Northern Lights clearly. The night must be clear and dark to see the dancing lights. I recommend staying in Tromso for at least 4-6 days in order to ensure your ability to see the Northern Lights at least once during your stay.\n","wordCount":"949","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://live.staticflickr.com/7848/46472368975_350ebafef6_b.jpg","datePublished":"2023-01-15T10:30:30+01:00","dateModified":"2023-01-15T10:30:30+01:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Nicole"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://blogbirdeyeview.github.io/posts/norway/tromso/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Bird’s Eye View","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://blogbirdeyeview.github.io/assets/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://blogbirdeyeview.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Bird’s Eye View (Alt + H)">Bird’s Eye View</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://blogbirdeyeview.github.io/archives/ title=Archive><span>Archive</span></a></li><li><a href=https://blogbirdeyeview.github.io/country/ title=Countries><span>Countries</span></a></li><li><a href=https://blogbirdeyeview.github.io/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search&nbsp;<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" fill="currentcolor" class="bi bi-search" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path d="M11.742 10.344a6.5 6.5.0 10-1.397 1.398h-.001c.03.04.062.078.098.115l3.85 3.85a1 1 0 001.415-1.414l-3.85-3.85a1.007 1.007.0 00-.115-.1zM12 6.5a5.5 5.5.0 11-11 0 5.5 5.5.0 0111 0z"/></svg></span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Tromso, Norway</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-01-15 10:30:30 +0100 +0100'>January 15, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Nicole</div></header><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=eager src=https://live.staticflickr.com/7848/46472368975_350ebafef6_b.jpg alt="Northern Lights over the mountains"><p>Northern Lights</p></figure><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#tromso-norway aria-label="Tromso, Norway">Tromso, Norway</a></li><li><a href=#the-most-magical-place-on-earth aria-label="The Most Magical Place on Earth">The Most Magical Place on Earth</a><ul><li><a href=#timing-is-key aria-label="Timing is Key">Timing is Key</a></li><li><a href=#traveling-through-tromso aria-label="Traveling through Tromso">Traveling through Tromso</a></li><li><a href=#make-your-way-to-the-city-center aria-label="Make your way to the City Center">Make your way to the City Center</a><ul><li><a href=#food-tips aria-label="Food Tips">Food Tips</a></li><li><a href=#what-to-see aria-label="What to See">What to See</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#fjords-fjords-and-more-fjords aria-label="Fjords, Fjords, and more Fjords">Fjords, Fjords, and more Fjords</a></li><li><a href=#did-someone-say-northern-lights aria-label="Did someone say Northern Lights?">Did someone say Northern Lights?</a><ul><li><a href=#where-to-look-up aria-label="Where to look?
